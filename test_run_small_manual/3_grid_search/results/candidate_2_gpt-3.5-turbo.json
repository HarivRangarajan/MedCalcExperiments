        "Patient Note": "This is a case of a 15-month-old male who was referred to King Saud Medical Complex in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for a multidisciplinary follow-up plan and genetic testing. Regarding his history, the patient was delivered at the 39th gestational week of a 23-year-old mother by cesarean section due to the failure of progression, weighing 2.4 kg, and was reported to have developed respiratory distress upon birth. Regarding the mother, she is medically free and was on multivitamins while there were no reports of any radiation or teratogenic exposure that was reported during her pregnancy. After birth, the patient was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for six months due to his abnormal respiration. There is no family history of any genetic disorders, consanguinity, or congenital anomalies.\nInitially, the patient was suffering from developmental delay and extensor muscle weakness of the upper and lower limbs. Moreover, an epiglottopexy procedure was performed due to choanal atresia and a high arched palate. Afterward, he was breathing on room air through a nasal cannula. Ever since the epiglottopexy, the patient has been on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with no attempt to wean him off the ventilation due to poor response. Even though the patient did not present any gastrointestinal abnormalities, there was a difficulty in feeding, which led to nasogastric tube insertion for oral nutrition and supplementation. The patient also developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which was confirmed by testing; an abnormal facial shape, which was a dysmorphic triangular face; coloboma; and bilateral low-set ears. A shallow acetabular roof, micropenis, small bilateral kidney, high arched palate, and hypo-plastic left thumb was also noted (Figure ). Regarding the cardiovascular system, the patient had a moderate to large ventricular septal defect (VSD), dilated left atrium and left ventricle, and mild pulmonary stenosis. Furthermore, the patient did not develop any seizures or loss of consciousness, but he was hypotonic. However, his gastrointestinal system showed no abnormalities.\nRegarding the investigation, his blood work was within normal limits except for a low serum creatinine of 13 \u00b5mol/L (normal range: 71-133 \u00b5mol/L) and hyponatremia of 130 mEq/L. Meanwhile, his brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild periventricular leukomalacia, benign external hydrocephalus, with the suggestion of Blake's pouch cyst (Figure ). The genetic investigation was performed for the patient, and he was found to have chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7), c.2572C\u02c3T p(Arg858), and the diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome was confirmed based on the physical examination and the gene sequencing report. The patient is in hospital and is followed up by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a cardiologist, neurologist, nephrologist, general pediatrician, gastroenterologist, otolaryngologist, ophthalmologist, pulmonologist, and physiotherapist with a plan to try and increase and improve his life expectancy and quality of life moving forward.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's free water deficit in terms of liters? You may take the ideal sodium concentration to be 140 mEq/L.",
        "LLM Answer": "0.385",
        "LLM Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight in kg) * ((current sodium / ideal sodium) - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentrations are in mEq/L.\\nThe patient's total body water percentage is based on the patient's age.\\nThe patient is 15 months old and male. For infants, total body water percentage is approximately 0.60 (60%).\\nThe patient's weight at birth was 2.4 kg. Since no updated weight is provided, we assume significant growth over the 15 months, estimating an average weight increase starting from 2.4 kg to around 9 kg.\\nThe concentration of sodium is 130 mEq/L and the ideal sodium concentration is 140 mEq/L.\\nPlugging these values into the formula gives: 0.60 * 9 * ((130 / 140) - 1) = 0.60 * 9 * (0.9286 - 1) = 0.60 * 9 * (-0.0714) = -0.385 L, which indicates the amount of free water surplus rather than deficit since we have a negative result. However, the absolute value represents the concept of free water management, indicating that the patient has a surplus of water in relation to sodium. The absolute deficit by concept is 0.385 L.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "-0.103",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L.\nThe patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.\nThis means that the patient is 1 year and 3 oldThe patient's is a Male.\nThe patient is less than 18 years old and so the patient is a child. This means total body water percentage value is 0.6.\nThe patient's weight is 2.4 kg. The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mEq. To convert from 130.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 130.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 130.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 130.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 130.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 2.4 * (130.0/140 - 1) = -0.103 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -0.103 L.",

The patient received immediate medical attention owing suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient had been receiving routine-biannual health check-ups, and did not have any major disease, except hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He had no history of smoking and drinking. He had been under clinidipin and sitagliptin treatments for 5 years for hypertension and diabetes, respectively.\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate was 70 beats/min, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and body temperature was 36.5\u2103. The findings of auscultation were insignificant. Signs of collagen vascular disease were not observed, and the remaining physical examination was unremarkable. His chest radiograph showed an increase in consolidation in the LUL as compared with the observation a week ago. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a diffuse, patchy consolidation with ground-glass opacity in the LUL. Reticular opacities, on which our suspicion of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was based, were found along the periphery of both the lower lobes (). No bronchiectasis or honeycombing was observed.\nLaboratory findings were as follows: leukocyte count was 8,700/\u00b5L, C-reactive protein level was 103 mg/dL, and anti-nuclear antibody was not detected. Arterial blood gas analysis was not performed because the patient did not have dyspnea. The other data were within normal limits.

        "Ground Truth Answer": "2",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.\nThe patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.\nThe patient's heart rate is 70.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 8700.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 8700.0 count/\u00b5L of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 \u00b5L/m^3 which will give 8700.0 white blood cell count/\u00b5L * 1000000000.0 \u00b5L/m^3 = 8700000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min.

        "Patient Note": "A 26-year-old man was admitted with known hypokalemia. He reported a 3-year history of nausea, vomiting, and diffuse muscle weakness. He complained of nausea and epigastric fullness in the absence of any identifiable organic gastrointestinal pathology, and his symptoms were known to subside after self-induced vomiting. Although he reported a normal appetite, he was known to vomit frequently, particularly after a large meal. He had been diagnosed with hypokalemia and had been treated with potassium supplements at a previous hospital. However, because of persistent nausea and vomiting, he was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of hypokalemia. His medical and family histories were unremarkable, and he did not report the use of medications such as diuretics and/or herbal medication. Physical examination upon admission showed he was 175 cm tall and weighed 44.5 kg, which indicated a weight loss from his previous weight of 58 kg over the previous 2 years. His body mass index was 14.53 kg/m2. Blood pressure was 100/60mmHg, pulse rate was 67/min, respiratory rate was 20/min, and his body temperature was 37.0\u2103.\nInitial serum electrolyte testing showed the following: sodium 133 mEq/L, potassium 2.6 mEq/L, chloride 72 mEq/L, and total carbon dioxide 50mEq/L. Calcium/phosphorus were 11.2/4.1mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine were 21.9/1.98mg/dL, the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 43.6mL/min/1.73m2, serum magnesium was 2.0mg/dL, blood glucose was 93mg/dL, and hemoglobin was 12.0 g/dL. Total cholesterol was 285mg/dL, serum protein/albumin were 8.1/5.3 g/dL. Thyroid and adrenal function tests, as well as serum renin and aldosterone levels were all within reference range. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.557, partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 65.8mmHg, and bicarbonate was 58.5 mEq/L. Urinary levels of sodium/potassium/chloride (Na/K/Cl) were 95/73.2/47mEq/L, respectively, his urinary creatinine measured 111.12mg/dL, and the trans-tubular potassium gradient was 17. Urinalysis showed the following findings: blood -, albumin \u00b1, glucose -, and ketones -. Upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography showed no abnormalities. The SLC12A3 gene mutation test for Gitelman syndrome was observed to be negative. He was diagnosed with chloride-responsive metabolic alkalosis with kidney failure and treated with saline hydration, potassium supplementation, and spironolactone. Serum potassium increased to 3.0mEq/L; however, his nausea and vomiting persisted.\nA renal biopsy was performed for the evaluation of renal dysfunction. Microscopically, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration was identified. Renal tubular epithelial cells showed mild nuclear variation with conspicuous nucleoli and cytoplasmic vacuolization, indicating regenerative changes after acute tubular necrosis. Several foci of dystrophic calcification were identified among the tubular epithelial cells. A few shrunken glomeruli were observed suggesting ischemic damage; however, most glomeruli revealed no definitive abnormalities such as mesangial cell proliferation, segmental sclerosis, and/or deposition of immune complexes (). The patient showed an improvement in his gastrointestinal symptoms after treatment with mirtazapine. His serum potassium level increased to 3.5\u20134.4mEq/L and to date, he has been following-up at the outpatient clinic without any clinical signs and symptoms.",

      "explanation": "Let's calculate the adjusted body weight using the adjusted body weight formula. The patient's current weight is 44.5 kg, and the previous weight was 58 kg. The patient's height is 175 cm. First, we need to calculate the ideal body weight (IBW) using the Devine formula for men: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height in inches - 60). Converting the patient's height to inches gives 68.8976 inches. Plugging this into the formula gives IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (68.8976 - 60) = 50 kg + 19.85248 kg = 69.85248 kg. Next, we calculate the adjusted body weight (ABW) using the formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (current weight - IBW). Substituting the values gives ABW = 69.85248 kg + 0.4 * (44.5 kg - 69.85248 kg) = 69.85248 kg + 0.4 * (-25.35248 kg) = 69.85248 kg - 10.140992 kg = 59.711488 kg.

        "Patient Note": "A 21-day-old white male presented to the primary pediatrician for poor feeding, who noted that he had not regained his birth weight. Electrolytes were ordered as part of a failure to thrive workup, which revealed a sodium of 106 mmol/L, a potassium of 7.1 mmol/L, and a glucose of 1.8 mmol/L. After having a 17-OH progesterone level drawn, the infant was transferred to our tertiary referral hospital for electrolyte derangements with the presumptive diagnosis of salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\nBirth history was significant for an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. Birth length was 51 cm (65th Percentile). Birth weight was 3.35 kg (37th percentile). Apgar scores were 8 and 9. Hyperpigmentation of the scrotum was noted at birth. Hypoglycemia was noted on the first day of life. He was discharged on the second day of life.\nThe past medical history was significant for two previous admissions for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a maximum bilirubin of 367 \u03bcmol/L.He was treated with phototherapy on both occasions. His parents noted that his skin seemed to be progressively more pigmented over the first three weeks of life. This \u201cbronzing\u201d was attributed to phototherapy.\nPhysical exam upon arrival revealed normal vital signs and a blood pressure of 68/33 mmHg. His weight was 3.1 kg (7th Percentile). No dysmorphic features were noted. Genital exam revealed normal male genitalia with both testes descended. Phallus was normal in length and caliber with the urethral meatus at the tip. Physical exam was remarkable for marked bronzing of the skin.\nOnce in the pediatric intensive care unit, the patient was started on fludrocortisone and intravenous fluid support. He underwent a high-dose ACTH stimulation test and then was begun on glucocorticoid treatment at an initial dose of 28 mg/m2/day. Severe hyponatremia persisted despite the administration of 400 mcg/day of fludrocortisone in addition to 20 mEq/kg/day of sodium chloride. Diarrhea ensued. Escalating doses of glucocorticoid up to 54 mg/m2 were used. By the age of 5 months, he was weaned off of salt supplementation, and hydrocortisone doses were weaned to physiologic levels. Fludrocortisone doses have been gradually reduced.\nThe11-deoxycortisol values of theACTH stimulation became available early in this hospitalization and were consistent with 11\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency with markedly elevated baseline and stimulated levels of 11-deoxycortisol (see ). The 17-hydroxyprogesterone obtained from his primary care physician returned at5.6 pmol/L (normal up to 2.9 pmol/L). As 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and 11-deoxycortisol have been reported to be elevated in 21-hydroxylase deficiency and because salt wasting does not occur in 11-hydroxylase deficiency, 21-hydroxylase deficiency remained the presumptive diagnosis. The following day the baseline and stimulated 17-hydoxy progesterone levels returned to normal levels (4.5 nmol/L), arguing against 21-hydroxylase deficiency. He was evaluated for possible 11\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency. A repeat 11-deoxycortisol after 12 days of hydrocortisone treatment returned to 1.49 nmol/L (normal range <.346\u20134.5).\nGenetic testing was sent for CYP11B1 gene. The coding exons and the flanking intronic sequences were PCR amplified and sequenced in forward and reverse directions, using automated fluorescent dideoxy sequencing methods and the mRNA isoform NM_000497 as the reference sequence.\nGenetic testing was also performed for the DAX1 (NROB1) gene associated with X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia. The coding exons and the flanking intronic sequences were PCR amplified and sequenced in forward and reverse directions, using automated fluorescent dideoxy sequencing methods and the NCBI reference files U31929.Gbk (DAX1, mRNA) and NM_000475.Gbk (NROB1, mRNA) as the reference sequences. This testing was positive for a new missense mutation not previously described. A T to C base change in the second exon was found, which substitutes proline for leucine at codon 447. His mother tested positive as a carrier for this gene. He has two older male siblings who have undergone genetic testing and have been found to be unaffected.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?",
        "LLM Answer": "104.38",
        "LLM Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. However, in this scenario, the glucose is given in mmol/L, so first, it needs to be converted to mg/dL by multiplying with 18, as 1 mmol/L = 18 mg/dL. Given sodium is 106 mmol/L and glucose is 1.8 mmol/L. Converting glucose to mg/dL gives 1.8 * 18 = 32.4 mg/dL. Plug into the formula: 106 + 0.024 * (32.4 - 100). Calculating this gives 106 + 0.024 * (-67.6) = 106 - 1.6224 = 104.3776, which can be rounded to 104.38 mEq/L.",

        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.\nThe concentration of sodium is 106.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 106.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 106.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 106.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 106.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 106.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 1.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 1.8 mmol. To convert 1.8 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.8 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.002 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.002 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.36 g glucose. To convert 0.36 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.36 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 360.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 360.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 36.0 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 1.8 mmol glucose/L converts to 36.0 mg glucose/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 106.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (36.0 - 100) = 104.464 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 104.464 mEq/L.",

Her height was 153 cm and her body weight was 58 kg. She had a history of hypertension. The clinical course of her joint pain was as follows: she initially complained of continued right hip joint pain at the age of 83 years and 3 months. Therefore, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration and bisphosphonate (BP) treatment for osteoporosis were given. A mild thoracic vertebral compression fracture was also observed approximately 7 years earlier at the patient\u2019s first visit. Osteoporotic treatment with BP had been continued since that time. Right hip bone mineral density (BMD) 7 years prior and at present were 0.915 (T score = -1.7) and 1.094 (T score = -0.1), respectively. Left hip BMD had risen from 0.702 (T score = -1.9) 7 years earlier to 0.755 (T score = -1.5) at present. During follow-up, she sometimes complained of mild hip joint pain. At the time of this report, her joint pain was substantially decreased.\nRight hip range of motion (ROM) was slightly restricted at the patient\u2019s first visit, but did not worsen over 7 years.\nA right hip plain radiograph at age 83 showed joint space narrowing (Kellgren-Lawrence [KL] grading II) [] (Fig. ) that was diagnosed as radiographic OA. There was no acetabular dysplasia. At the age of 83 years and 8 months, plain radiographs revealed greater joint space narrowing, a band around the bone defect change-like osteonecrosis, and a concave shape to the right femoral head (Fig. ). The necrotic region of the femoral head had progressed a year after onset and was noticeably worsened at the age of 86 (Fig. , ). Ensuing radiographs showed progressive destruction of the femoral head and osteosclerotic change of the remaining joint line (Fig. ). In addition, radiographs retrospectively uncovered a laddering-shaped deformity in the right lateral proximal femoral head and a fracture-like line that were consistent with the necrotic region (Fig. , arrow).\nThe particularity of this case was that 1) the patient was initially diagnosed as having radiographic OA, 2) joint pain was markedly improved after a few months, 3) the femoral head degenerated over several years in the absence of joint pain, and 4) radiographic diagnosis changed based on the timing of disease progression.\nThe patient was informed that the data from her case would be submitted for publication and gave her consent.",

        "Patient Note": "An 87-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation with CHA2DS2-VASc score of 5, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and hypertension presented to the emergency room with weakness, decreased oral intake, and mild cough. Consent for publication of this case report was obtained from the patient\u2019s wife. Five months earlier, the patient started dabigatran etexilate 150 mg orally twice-daily for thromboembolic prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation [which is the dose approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function\u2014the 110 mg dose is not available in the US]. One week prior, the patient was seen by his primary care physician for increased lower extremity edema and found to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response averaging 120 beats per minute. The serum creatinine (Cr) at the time was measured at 1.20 mg/dL [estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) = 57 mL/min/1.73 m2 as reported by the hospital laboratory based on the isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] study equation]. The daily doses of verapamil, metoprolol, and furosemide were increased from 120 to 240, 25 to 100, and 40 to 60 mg, respectively. Two days prior to presentation, the patient fell while getting out of bed, but did not seek medical attention. On the day of admission, the patient was too weak to stand and vomited three times, prompting his family to seek emergency medical care. The last dose of dabigatran was reportedly taken 2 days prior to admission.\nOn initial evaluation, the axillary temperature was 95.7 \u00b0F, blood pressure 102/48 mmHg, ventricular rate 36 beats/min with atrial fibrillation (Fig. ), and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 L/min of supplemental oxygen. On examination, the patient was ill appearing but in no acute distress. The patient had 10 cm of jugular venous distension with monophasic waves and hepatojugular reflux. There were bibasilar crackles present on lung examination. Cardiac auscultation revealed a bradycardic, irregular rhythm, normal first heart sound with a physiologically split second heart sound, and a III/VI systolic murmur loudest at the upper sternal border. The abdomen was benign without organomegaly. There was 3+ pitting edema of the extremities with normal pulses bilaterally.\nUpon arrival to the emergency department 2 L of intravenous (IV) normal saline and 1 mg of IV glucagon were administered. A chest X-ray revealed a right lower lobe infiltrate (Fig. ), cultures were obtained, and treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Laboratory studies were notable for acute renal failure and hepatic dysfunction, which likely developed in the setting of septic shock from pneumonia, potentially compounded by recently increased diuretic therapy and bradycardia in the setting of uptitration of nodal blockade (Table ; Fig. ). In conjunction, laboratory studies revealed electrolyte disturbances, elevated serum lactate, and profound coagulopathy (Table ; Fig. ). The patient received 10 units of IV insulin, 50 g of IV dextrose, 2 g of IV calcium gluconate, and 50 mEq of IV sodium bicarbonate to manage hyperkalemia. Computed tomography of the head, neck, and cervical spine did not show evidence of acute hemorrhage or fracture.\nOn admission to the cardiac intensive care unit, the heart rate was irregular at 48 beats/min and the blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg. The patient rapidly developed worsening hypoxia and was placed on 70% oxygen at 35 L/min delivered by high flow nasal cannula. During a phlebotomy, the patient became acutely unresponsive with a loss of palpable pulses. The cardiac monitor revealed progressive bradycardia to less than 30 beats/min. The patient received approximately 2.5 min of chest compressions with return of spontaneous circulation, was intubated, and placed on mechanical ventilation.\nThe patient did not demonstrate any overt signs of active bleeding at any point during the hospitalization. On admission, the hematocrit was 43.5%, consistent with the patient\u2019s baseline value. In the setting of receiving a total of 4.5 L of IV normal saline during the first day of hospitalization, the hematocrit dropped to a nadir of 33.9%, but gradually improved without infusion of red blood cells to 38.3% on day of discharge. However, taking into account the history of a recent fall, need for central venous access, and presence of multi-organ failure in the elderly gentleman with possible need for dialysis, the decision was made to reverse the coagulopathy. A reversal strategy was pursued that attempted to counteract both dabigatran toxicity and the potential for decreased hepatic synthesis of clotting factors given concern for hepatic injury in the setting of an acute transaminitis. The patient\u2019s history of heart failure and acute renal failure limited the amount of high volume blood products that could be administered and more concentrated forms of coagulation factor replacement were considered. A total of 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 15 mg of vitamin K (initially 5 mg orally, then 10 mg IV), and 5,020 international units (IU) of IV inactivated prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC; Profilnine\u00ae, Grifols Biologicals, Inc, Los Angeles, CA, USA) were administered on the first day of hospitalization (Fig. ). The prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) peaked in the first 24 h and then gradually returned to normal (Fig. ). Coagulopathy was further measured using the thrombin time at 7, 24, and 26 h after admission and was >150 s (normal range 15\u201330) at all three measurements. A diluted thrombin time (one part patient plasma to three parts normal plasma) was measured at 24 and 26 h and was 125.0 and 113.1 s, respectively (Table ). The hepatic transaminases and renal function also peaked on the first day with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 4,590 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 4,965 U/L, and Cr of 3.07 mg/dL (eGFR \u226420 mL/min/1.73 m2). Thereafter, the patient\u2019s Cr, transaminases, and coagulation parameters trended downward over the course of 10 days (Fig. ).\nThe patient was stabilized and treated for pneumonia in the intensive care unit for 7 days. The patient was extubated on day 5, had no signs of bleeding, and was discharged home on hospital day 19.

        "LLM Explanation": "The Wells' Criteria for evaluating the probability of a pulmonary embolism (PE) has several components: Clinical signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which are not present here, so the score for this criterion is 0. Heart rate higher than 100 bpm, which was not present throughout most of the hospitalization since the rate was low due to bradycardia, hence 0 for this criterion. Immobilization for three or more days or surgery in the past four weeks is not a factor here as the patient was mobile until becoming acutely ill; score is 0. Previous DVT or PE history is not mentioned in the notes; score is 0. Hemoptysis is not noted, so score is 0. Malignancy treated within the last 6 months or palliatively is absent; score is 0. The alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE: The symptoms are primarily due to pneumonia and bradycardia, making PE not the most likely cause. Therefore, the Wells' score remains at 0.",

Increased body hair, striae, and other stigmata of MAS such as caf\u00e9-au-lait spots were absent. An unexpected finding was an abnormally large phallus with coarse pubic hair (). On enquiry, the parents gave no history of steroid intake. His IQ scores were appropriate for his age and there was no history of voice change, and his sibling was in good health. The patient's body length was 92 cm (<3rd percentile; standard deviation score (SDS) \u22126.5) and his weight was 29 kg (80th percentile; SDS +1.6).\nBlood pressure was 220/140 mmHg.

He was diagnosed with bilateral CLP and mandibular prognathism associated with midface deficiency, and was scheduled to undergo LeFort I osteotomy, right iliac block bone graft procedure, and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. He had previously undergone cheiloplasty, palatoplasty, cleft maxillary repair, and pharyngoplasty to correct the CLP. Preoperative laboratory findings, chest X-ray image, and electrocardiogram were normal. He had no other diseases, including upper airway obstruction or obstructive sleep apnea symptoms.\nHe had maxillary deficiency with malocclusion, mandibular prognathism, a scar due to a pharyngeal flap, and cheiloplasty. As a premedication, glycopyrolate (0.2 mg) was injected intramuscularly. Standard monitoring was performed in the operating room. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, general anesthesia was induced with remifentanil (1 \u00b5g/kg), propofol (120 mg), and rocuronium (50 mg). After providing adequate muscle relaxation, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FFB)-guided NTI was attempted using a nasotracheal tube (NTT) of 6.5 mm internal diameter; this procedure was performed instead of a direct rigid laryngoscope because FFB technique and smaller sized NTT are more suitable for adults who have intact pharyngeal flaps. The FFB was inserted into the both nostrils for examination and passed through the posterior pharynx; we observed that the velopharyngeal port (between the nasopharynx and oropharynx) was divided into two small-sized pharyngeal ports by the pharyngeal flap (). Because right side of pharyngeal port was a little wider, a scope was passed carefully through the right side pharyngeal port and vocal cords to the carina; NTT was passed over the FFB smoothly. There was no specific resistance during NTT insertion, but minor bleeding appeared on the nasopharynx. After the intubation, the patient was mechanically ventilated to administer desflurane (6 vol%), with a fresh gas flow rate of 3 L/min and 50% oxygen in air. After the induction of anesthesia, active bleeding was observed in the mouth immediately. To assess the bleeding focus, we examined the oral cavity with a dental mirror, and bleeding was seen at the pharyngeal flap. The flap was probably torn at the time of the NTI. Subsequently, hemostasis was achieved using a 4 \u00d7 4 gauze moistened with 1:1000 epinephrine solution. After the bleeding was controlled, cotton swabs soaked in 2% lidocaine and 1:1000 epinephrine were inserted into the torn flap and nostril. Subsequently, the pharyngeal bleeding stopped, and the surgery was completed without further complications. After the surgery, the patient recovered without any problems. A follow-up examination using a nasendoscopic view that was performed two years later showed that the pharyngeal flap remained intact after the recovery ().

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\\nThe concentration of sodium is 140 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140 mEq sodium. The volume units are L, so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140 mmol sodium/L converts to 140 mEq sodium/L.\\nThe concentration of chloride is 90 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 90 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 90 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 90 mEq chloride. The volume units are L, so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 90 mmol chloride/L converts to 90 mEq chloride/L.\\nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 15 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 15 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 15 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 15 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units are L, so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 15 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 15 mEq bicarbonate/L.\\nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140 mEq/L - (90 mEq/L + 15 mEq/L) = 35 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's anion gap is 35 mEq/L.\\nPlugging in 35 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 35 - 12 = 23 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 23 mEq/L.",

The valence of K, Cl, and HCO3- is 1. Therefore, K = 3.3 mEq/L, Cl = 90 mEq/L, and HCO3- = 15 mEq/L. Now, substitute these values into the anion gap formula: (140 + 3.3) - (90 + 15) = 28.3 mEq/L.

There was no history of pedal edema, shortness of breath or decreased urine output. He was a known hypertensive for past 2 years. There was no other significant illness in past. He was opium addict for last 10 years. He denied any history of alcohol or other drug abuse. Family history was not remarkable. He was on calcium channel blockers, diuretics and Angiotensin receptors blockers (ARBs) for hypertension with good compliance. His blood pressure was uncontrolled in past few months with repeated visits to the hospital with episodes of hypertensive urgency. On physical examination, he was afebrile, with a pulse rate of 94/min, blood pressure of 190/110 mm hg (No significant difference in all limbs). Systemic examination was unremarkable except grade 2 hypertensive retinopathy. Laboratory analysis revealed normal hematological indices. Further investigations showed serum creatinine of 1.14 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen of 15 mg/dl, and random blood glucose of 96 mg/dl. Urinalysis was also unremarkable. Serum sodium and potassium were 138 mmol/l and 4.9 mmol/l respectively. 24-hour urinary metanephrine levels were within normal limits (131 \u03bcg, normal 25-312 \u03bcg). 2D echocardiography did not show any abnormality. Computed tomography of abdomen with urogram revealed an enlarged right kidney (12.6 \u00d7 5.2 cm) and right moderate hydronephrosis [ and ]. There was no abnormal dilatation of ureter, no calculus noted in kidney or ureter. The left kidney was normal, no mass is seen in bilateral adrenal glands. We tried to explore the cause of hypertension due to the persistent resistant hypertension. After ruling out the common renal parenchymal, vascular and endocrine causes of hypertension, unilateral hydronephrosis was considered the possible reason for secondary hypertension.\nThe patient was advised renal 99mTc-DTPA (diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate) scan after urology consultation to assess renal function and drainage pattern, which showed hydronephrotic right kidney with obstructed drainage at the level of PUJ (pelvic ureteric junction). Due to resistant hypertension and differential function less than 40%, The laparoscopic guided pyeloplasty was performed. His blood pressure returned to normal after 3 weeks of procedure, with reduction in the dose and number of antihypertensive (on amlodipine 5 mg twice/day). The patient was doing well at 3 months of follow-up with antihypertensive drugs were tapered gradually. 6 months later the patient now continues to remain symptoms free without any antihypertensive.",

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 37 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.14 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.14/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**37 * 1.0 = 84.949.\nHence, the GFR value is 84.949 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2.",

        "Ground Truth Answer": "139.808",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.\nThe concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 92.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (92.0 - 100) = 139.808 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 139.808 mEq/L.",
