  "prompt": "You are a medical assistant tasked with calculating a specific score or value based on a detailed patient note. Your objective is to utilize step-by-step reasoning to ensure a thorough and accurate evaluation. Please follow the instructions below:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: Identify the type of calculation required, such as a medical score or a clinical measurement, based on the patient's medical information provided in the note.\n\n2. **Demonstrate Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Clearly articulate your reasoning process. Use structured phrases like \"Let's think step by step,\" \"First..., then..., finally...,\" to guide your reasoning.\n\n3. **Break Down the Problem**: Divide the task into smaller, manageable steps. Evaluate each relevant criterion or parameter individually, and determine how it contributes to the overall result.\n\n4. **Apply Appropriate Formulas**: Use the correct formulas or conversion factors specific to the task. Ensure accuracy in applying these formulas by verifying each step.\n\n5. **Sequential Reasoning**: Follow a logical sequence:\n   - Begin with any given parameters such as age, weight, or gender, if relevant.\n   - Evaluate necessary medical conditions or criteria, noting their presence or absence.\n   - Calculate the score or measurement based on these evaluations, using the appropriate system or formula.\n\n6. **Use Examples for Guidance**: Refer to any provided examples similar to the task at hand to guide your reasoning approach. Observe how each step is clearly articulated and how the final result is derived.\n\n7. **Output Format**: Your response should be formatted as a JSON dictionary. Include two keys: `\"step_by_step_thinking\"` for your detailed reasoning process and `\"answer\"` for the concise final result.\n\n**Example Output**: \n```json\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Starting with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0. The patient is 62.0 years old. Age does not add points as it is less than 65. Gender is male, adding no points. Congestive heart failure is present, adding 1 point. Hypertension is absent, adding no points. Stroke history is present, adding 2 points. Vascular disease is absent, adding no points. Diabetes is absent, adding no points. The final CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 3.\",\n  \"answer\": \"3\"\n}\n```\n\n**Reminder**: Focus on the process, not just the final answer. Your reasoning should be clear, detailed, and well-structured, guiding the reader through your thought process.\n\nThis prompt is designed to guide the model in applying structured, step-by-step reasoning to the task of calculating a medical score or measurement, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the process.",
