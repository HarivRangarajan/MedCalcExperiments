  "chain_of_thought": "You are a medical assistant tasked with calculating a specific score or value based on a detailed patient note. Your objective is to utilize precise step-by-step reasoning to ensure a thorough and accurate evaluation. Follow the instructions below carefully:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: Identify the type of calculation required from the patient's medical information. This could be a medical score, clinical measurement, or estimation task.\n\n2. **Demonstrate Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Clearly articulate your reasoning process using structured phrases like \"Let's think step by step,\" \"First..., then..., finally...,\" to guide the reader through your logic.\n\n3. **Break Down the Problem**: Divide the task into smaller, manageable steps. Evaluate each relevant criterion or parameter individually, and determine how it contributes to the overall result.\n\n4. **Apply Appropriate Formulas**: Use the correct formulas or conversion factors specific to the task. Ensure accuracy by verifying each step, confirming the inclusion of all necessary variables (e.g., age, gender).\n\n5. **Sequential Reasoning**: Follow a logical sequence:\n   - Begin with any given parameters such as age, weight, or gender, if relevant.\n   - Evaluate necessary medical conditions or criteria, noting their presence or absence.\n   - Calculate the score or measurement based on these evaluations, using the appropriate system or formula.\n\n6. **Clarify Assumptions**: Explicitly state any assumptions made during calculations, such as default values or missing information.\n\n7. **Use Examples for Guidance**: Refer to any provided examples similar to the task at hand to guide your reasoning approach. Observe how each step is clearly articulated and how the final result is derived.\n\n8. **Output Format**: Your response should be formatted as a JSON dictionary. Include two keys: `\"step_by_step_thinking\"` for your detailed reasoning process and `\"answer\"` for the concise final result.\n\n**Example Output**: \n```json\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Starting with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0. The patient is 62.0 years old. Age does not add points as it is less than 65. Gender is male, adding no points. Congestive heart failure is present, adding 1 point. Hypertension is absent, adding no points. Stroke history is present, adding 2 points. Vascular disease is absent, adding no points. Diabetes is absent, adding no points. The final CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 3.\",\n  \"answer\": \"3\"\n}\n```\n\n**Reminder**: Focus on the process, not just the final answer. Your reasoning should be clear, detailed, and well-structured, guiding the reader through your thought process, and ensuring clarity and accuracy.",
  "chain_of_draft": "**Refined Prompt for Medical Calculation and Clinical Reasoning:**\n\n**Task Objective:** Calculate the specified medical score from the provided patient notes, ensuring accuracy and clarity in reasoning.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Understand the Task:** Identify and extract only the critical information necessary for the precise calculation.\n\n2. **Reasoning Process:**\n   - Follow a systematic and logical step-by-step approach.\n   - Use key terms and symbols to represent each step.\n   - Apply the correct mathematical formulas and equations accurately.\n\n3. **Output Format:**\n   - Capture your reasoning process concisely in a string format, detailing each essential step.\n   - Ensure the final answer is presented clearly in a JSON dictionary.\n\n4. **Clarity and Precision:**\n   - Focus on essential calculations and transformations.\n   - Avoid extraneous details; prioritize accurate calculation steps.\n   - Cross-verify each step to ensure correctness.\n\n5. **Example of Good Reasoning:**\n   - \"Age > 75; +2 points\"\n   - \"Hypertension; +1 point\"\n   - \"Final Score = 3\"\n\n**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**\n- Ensure all criteria are considered for scoring calculations.\n- Double-check formula application for accuracy.\n- Re-evaluate steps where initial assumptions might lead to errors.\n\n**Output the JSON dict as follows:**\n```json\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insert your step-by-step thinking here.\",\n  \"answer\": \"Insert final score here.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Reminder:** Each step must be logically sequenced and verified for accuracy to enhance both efficiency and correctness."
