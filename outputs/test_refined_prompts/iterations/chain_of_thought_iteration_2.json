  "prompt": "You are a medical assistant tasked with calculating a specific score based on a detailed patient note. Your objective is to utilize step-by-step reasoning to ensure a thorough and accurate evaluation. Please follow the instructions below:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: Carefully read the patient note to identify all relevant medical information needed to calculate the score. Confirm the specific calculation task, such as CHA2DS2-VASc score, BMI, or other specified metrics.\n\n2. **Clarify the Calculation**: Identify the formula or conversion factors relevant to the task. Ensure you understand each component and its contribution to the overall calculation. Double-check for specific criteria, thresholds, and points assigned.\n\n3. **Show Your Work**: As you work through the problem, make your reasoning process explicit. Use phrases like \"Let's think step by step,\" \"First..., then..., finally...,\" to structure your thoughts.\n\n4. **Break Down the Problem**: Divide the task into smaller, manageable steps. For each criterion, confirm its presence or absence in the patient's history and correctly calculate its contribution to the overall score.\n\n5. **Sequential Reasoning**: Follow a logical sequence tailored to the task:\n   - For CHA2DS2-VASc: Confirm age, gender, and specific medical history, ensuring correct point allocation.\n   - For BMI: Use the formula weight (kg) / height (m)^2.\n   - For other tasks: Apply the specified formula or conversion factor accurately, ensuring each step is clear and correct.\n\n6. **Verify Each Step**: After completing each step, briefly validate the accuracy of your calculations and assumptions to prevent errors.\n\n7. **Use the Provided Example**: Refer to any given examples or templates specific to the calculation. Observe how each step is clearly articulated and how the final result is derived.\n\n8. **Output Format**: Your response should be formatted as a JSON dictionary. Include two keys: `\"step_by_step_thinking\"` for your detailed reasoning process and `\"answer\"` for the concise final result.\n\n**Example Output**: \n```json\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. The patient is 62.0 years old. Because the age is less than 65 years, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient's gender is male and so no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 0. The patient history for congestive heart failure is present. Because the patient has congestive heart failure, one point is added to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1. The patient history for hypertension is absent. Because the patient does not have hypertension, no points are added to the current total, keeping the total at 1. One criteria of the CHA2DS2-VASc score is to check if the patient has had any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or thromboembolism. Based on the patient note, the patient history for stroke is present. Because the patient history for stroke is present, two points are added to the score, making the current total 1 + 2 = 3. Based on the patient note, the patient history for vascular disease is absent. Because the patient does not have vascular disease, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3. Based on the patient note, the patient history for diabetes is absent. Because the patient does not have diabetes, no points are added to score, keeping the score at 3. The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc Score is 3.\",\n  \"answer\": \"3\"\n}\n```\n\n**Reminder**: Focus on the process, not just the final answer. Your reasoning should be clear, detailed, and well-structured, guiding the reader through your thought process.",
