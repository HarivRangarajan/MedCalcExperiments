  "prompt": "**Refined Prompt for Medical Calculation and Clinical Reasoning:**\n\n**Task Objective:** Calculate a specified medical score or measurement from patient notes using concise and precise reasoning steps.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Understand the Task:** Focus on the critical information needed to compute the required score or measurement from the patient note.\n\n2. **Reasoning Process:** \n   - Use systematic, step-by-step reasoning.\n   - Limit each reasoning step to 5 words or less.\n   - Utilize symbols, equations, or shorthand where applicable.\n\n3. **Output Format:** \n   - Present your reasoning as a concise string, encapsulating essential steps.\n   - Clearly provide the final answer within a JSON dictionary.\n\n4. **Clarity and Precision:**\n   - Omit non-essential details.\n   - Emphasize important calculations, transformations, and insights.\n   - Do not justify actions; focus solely on execution.\n\n5. **Example of Effective Reasoning:**\n   - \"Age > 65; +1 point\"\n   - \"Stroke history; +2 points\"\n   - \"Final Score = 3\"\n\n6. **Error Avoidance:**\n   - Double-check key components and calculations.\n   - Verify logical consistency and accuracy.\n   - Ensure all steps align with the calculation method.\n\n**Output the JSON dict as follows:**\n```json\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insert your step-by-step thinking here.\",\n  \"answer\": \"Insert final score here.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Reminder:** Ensure accuracy and logical flow while maintaining efficiency. Correct calculations depend on precise and coherent reasoning.",
