  "prompt": "**Refined Prompt for Medical Calculation and Clinical Reasoning:**\n\n**Task Objective:** Accurately compute a specified medical score or measurement from patient notes using structured and precise reasoning steps.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Understand the Task:**\n   - Identify critical data required for the calculation.\n   - Ensure comprehension of any conversion factors or specific formulae needed.\n\n2. **Reasoning Process:** \n   - Implement systematic, step-by-step reasoning.\n   - Limit each reasoning step to a concise format.\n   - Use symbols, equations, or shorthand where applicable.\n\n3. **Output Format:** \n   - Present your reasoning as a clear and concise string, encapsulating essential steps.\n   - Provide the final answer within a JSON dictionary.\n\n4. **Clarity and Precision:**\n   - Omit non-essential details.\n   - Prioritize accuracy and logical consistency.\n   - Focus on essential calculations, transformations, and insights.\n\n5. **Example of Effective Reasoning:**\n   - \"Age > 65; +1 point\"\n   - \"Stroke history; +2 points\"\n   - \"Final Score = 3\"\n\n6. **Error Avoidance:**\n   - Double-check all numerical values and calculations.\n   - Verify logical consistency and accuracy.\n   - Cross-verify with known standards or calculators if applicable.\n\n**Output the JSON dict as follows:**\n```json\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insert your step-by-step thinking here.\",\n  \"answer\": \"Insert final score here.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Reminder:** Ensure accuracy and logical flow while maintaining efficiency. Double-check calculations, especially conversion factors and scoring criteria, to ensure precision.",
