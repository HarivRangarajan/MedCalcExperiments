She complained of intermittent headache for about 1 year, and her previous blood pressure, measured 1 month prior to her detection of hypertension, had been normal. She showed mild hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) in a routine blood test, and an additional workup considering secondary hypertension was planned. Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.\nUpon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th\u201375th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th\u201375th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5\u20133.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4\u201348 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion (). The mass remained unenhanced during the arterial phase, and its margin was indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue (). During the delayed phase, its eccentric capsule showed enhancement, and an intact mass could be observed (), consistent with CT findings of JGC tumors.\nA right partial nephrectomy was performed, and a clear resection margin was identified. The well-encapsulated mass measured 2.5 cm \u00d72.2 cm\u00d72.0 cm in size with a partially cystic-appearing cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells stained positive for CD34 and focally positive for CD117 (C-Kit) and smooth muscle actin. ()\nPostoperatively, her blood pressure returned to normal (105/63 mmHg) without using any antihypertensive medication. On the 3rd postoperative day, the plasma renin activity (0.52 ng/mL/hr), serum aldosterone (3.9 ng/dL), and serum potassium (3.6 mmol/L) levels returned to normal. Her blood pressure and laboratory findings remained within the reference range over the next 3 years postoperatively until her last follow-up.\nQuestion: What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.\nResponse: To calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation, let's break down the process step by step, extracting necessary variables from the patient note:\n\n1. **Patient's Age**: \n   - The patient is 16 years old.\n\n2. **Gender Coefficient**: \n   - The patient is female, so the gender coefficient is 0.85.\n\n3. **Serum Creatinine**: \n   - The concentration of creatinine is provided as 0.57 mg/dL.\n\n4. **Height and Weight**: \n   - The patient's height is 162.8 cm, which is converted to meters: \\(162.8 \\, \\text{cm} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{m}}{100 \\, \\text{cm}} = 1.628 \\, \\text{m}\\).\n   - The patient's weight is 55 kg.\n\n5. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: \n   - BMI is calculated as \\(\\frac{\\text{weight (kg)}}{(\\text{height (m)})^2}\\).\n   - \\(\\text{BMI} = \\frac{55 \\, \\text{kg}}{1.628 \\, \\text{m} \\times 1.628 \\, \\text{m}} = 20.752 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2\\).\n   - The patient's BMI is approximately 20.8, which is considered normal weight.\n\n6. **Adjusted Body Weight**: \n   - Since the patient is of normal weight, we take the minimum of the ideal body weight and the actual body weight.\n   - Ideal body weight (IBW) for females is calculated using the formula: \\[ \\text{IBW} = 45.5 \\, \\text{kg} + 2.3 \\, \\text{kg for each inch over 5 feet} \\].\n   - Converting height to inches: \\(162.8 \\, \\text{cm} = 64.09 \\, \\text{inches}\\).\n   - For heights above 60 inches (5 feet), IBW is \\(45.5 + 2.3 \\times (64.09 - 60) = 54.918 \\, \\text{kg}\\).\n   - Adjusted body weight is the minimum of IBW and actual weight, therefore \\(54.918 \\, \\text{kg}\\).\n\n7. **Cockcroft-Gault Equation**: \n   - The formula is \\[ \\text{CrCl} = \\left( \\frac{(140 - \\text{age}) \\times \\text{adjusted weight} \\times \\text{gender coefficient}}{\\text{serum creatinine} \\times 72} \\right) \\].\n   - Substituting the known values: \\[ \\text{CrCl} = \\left( \\frac{(140 - 16) \\times 54.918 \\times 0.85}{0.57 \\times 72} \\right) \\].\n\n8. **Calculation**: \n   - Numerator: \\((140 - 16) \\times 54.918 \\times 0.85 = 124 \\times 54.918 \\times 0.85 = 5793.2212\\).\n   - Denominator: \\(0.57 \\times 72 = 41.04\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\text{CrCl} = \\frac{5793.2212}{41.04} = 141.042 \\, \\text{mL/min}\\).\n\nHence, the patient's creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation is **141.042 mL/min**.\n\nExample 2:\nPatient Note: A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination.

You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.\nResponse: Certainly! Let's follow the variant instruction to provide a complete worked demonstration for calculating the patient's creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation.\n\n### Relevant Patient Values:\n- **Age:** 16 years old\n- **Gender:** Female (gender coefficient = 0.85)\n- **Height:** 162.8 cm (convert to meters: 1.628 m)\n- **Weight:** 55 kg\n- **Serum Creatinine:** 0.57 mg/dL\n\n### Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculation:\n1. Convert height to meters: 162.8 cm = 1.628 meters.\n2. Calculate BMI: \n   \\[\n   \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kg}}{(\\text{height in m})^2} = \\frac{55}{1.628^2} = 20.752 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2\n   \\]\n   The patient's BMI is 20.752, indicating they are of normal weight.\n\n### Adjusted Body Weight Calculation:\n- Since the BMI is normal, use the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual body weight.\n- For normal weight, the adjusted body weight becomes the minimum, which is taken as the actual weight: **54.918 kg** (approximated to values in context).\n\n### Formula for Creatinine Clearance:\nThe Cockcroft-Gault Equation is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - \\text{age}) \\times \\text{adjusted weight} \\times \\text{gender coefficient}}{\\text{serum creatinine} \\times 72}\n\\]\n\n### Substituting Patient Values into the Formula:\n\\[\n\\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - 16) \\times 54.918 \\times 0.85}{0.57 \\times 72}\n\\]\n\n### Calculation:\n1. Calculate the numerator:\n   \\[\n   (140 - 16) \\times 54.918 \\times 0.85 = 124 \\times 54.918 \\times 0.85 = 5786.28552\n   \\]\n2. Calculate the denominator:\n   \\[\n   0.57 \\times 72 = 41.04\n   \\]\n3. Divide the results:\n   \\[\n   \\text{CrCl} = \\frac{5786.28552}{41.04} \\approx 141.042 \\, \\text{mL/min}\n   \\]\n\n### Final Numeric Answer:\nThe patient's creatinine clearance is approximately **141.042 mL/min**.\n\nExample 3:\nPatient Note: A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination.

She complained of intermittent headache for about 1 year, and her previous blood pressure, measured 1 month prior to her detection of hypertension, had been normal. She showed mild hypokalemia (3.4 mmol/L) in a routine blood test, and an additional workup considering secondary hypertension was planned. Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.\nUpon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th\u201375th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th\u201375th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5\u20133.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4\u201348 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion (). The mass remained unenhanced during the arterial phase, and its margin was indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue (). During the delayed phase, its eccentric capsule showed enhancement, and an intact mass could be observed (), consistent with CT findings of JGC tumors.\nA right partial nephrectomy was performed, and a clear resection margin was identified. The well-encapsulated mass measured 2.5 cm \u00d72.2 cm\u00d72.0 cm in size with a partially cystic-appearing cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells stained positive for CD34 and focally positive for CD117 (C-Kit) and smooth muscle actin. ()\nPostoperatively, her blood pressure returned to normal (105/63 mmHg) without using any antihypertensive medication. On the 3rd postoperative day, the plasma renin activity (0.52 ng/mL/hr), serum aldosterone (3.9 ng/dL), and serum potassium (3.6 mmol/L) levels returned to normal. Her blood pressure and laboratory findings remained within the reference range over the next 3 years postoperatively until her last follow-up.\nQuestion: What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.\nResponse: To calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation, let's break down the process step by step, extracting necessary variables from the patient note:\n\n1. **Patient's Age**: \n   - The patient is 16 years old.\n\n2. **Gender Coefficient**: \n   - The patient is female, so the gender coefficient is 0.85.\n\n3. **Serum Creatinine**: \n   - The concentration of creatinine is provided as 0.57 mg/dL.\n\n4. **Height and Weight**: \n   - The patient's height is 162.8 cm, which is converted to meters: \\(162.8 \\, \\text{cm} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{m}}{100 \\, \\text{cm}} = 1.628 \\, \\text{m}\\).\n   - The patient's weight is 55 kg.\n\n5. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: \n   - BMI is calculated as \\(\\frac{\\text{weight (kg)}}{(\\text{height (m)})^2}\\).\n   - \\(\\text{BMI} = \\frac{55 \\, \\text{kg}}{1.628 \\, \\text{m} \\times 1.628 \\, \\text{m}} = 20.752 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2\\).\n   - The patient's BMI is approximately 20.8, which is considered normal weight.\n\n6. **Adjusted Body Weight**: \n   - Since the patient is of normal weight, we take the minimum of the ideal body weight and the actual body weight.\n   - Ideal body weight (IBW) for females is calculated using the formula: \\[ \\text{IBW} = 45.5 \\, \\text{kg} + 2.3 \\, \\text{kg for each inch over 5 feet} \\].\n   - Converting height to inches: \\(162.8 \\, \\text{cm} = 64.09 \\, \\text{inches}\\).\n   - For heights above 60 inches (5 feet), IBW is \\(45.5 + 2.3 \\times (64.09 - 60) = 54.918 \\, \\text{kg}\\).\n   - Adjusted body weight is the minimum of IBW and actual weight, therefore \\(54.918 \\, \\text{kg}\\).\n\n7. **Cockcroft-Gault Equation**: \n   - The formula is \\[ \\text{CrCl} = \\left( \\frac{(140 - \\text{age}) \\times \\text{adjusted weight} \\times \\text{gender coefficient}}{\\text{serum creatinine} \\times 72} \\right) \\].\n   - Substituting the known values: \\[ \\text{CrCl} = \\left( \\frac{(140 - 16) \\times 54.918 \\times 0.85}{0.57 \\times 72} \\right) \\].\n\n8. **Calculation**: \n   - Numerator: \\((140 - 16) \\times 54.918 \\times 0.85 = 124 \\times 54.918 \\times 0.85 = 5793.2212\\).\n   - Denominator: \\(0.57 \\times 72 = 41.04\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\text{CrCl} = \\frac{5793.2212}{41.04} = 141.042 \\, \\text{mL/min}\\).\n\nHence, the patient's creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation is **141.042 mL/min**.\n\nExample 2:\nPatient Note: A 16-year-old female adolescent was referred to our hospital with severe hypertension (systolic pressure 178 mmHg), which was first detected 7 months prior to presentation during a routine annual physical examination.

Despite taking amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg twice a day), her blood pressure remained uncontrolled.\nUpon admission to our hospital, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 155 mmHg (>99th percentile) and 111 mmHg (>99th percentile) respectively. She was 162.8 cm tall (50th\u201375th percentile) and weighed 55 kg (50th\u201375th percentile). Physical examination including ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormality other than hypertension, and her family history was negative for hypertension or renal diseases. Laboratory examination revealed normal levels of hemoglobin (14.4 g/dL), serum creatinine (0.57 mg/dL), serum total cholesterol (144 mg/dL), and normal urinalysis. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and total carbon dioxide levels were 134 mmol/L, 3.4 mmol/L, 102 mmol/L, and 27 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma renin activity was 9.83 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5\u20133.3 ng/mL/hr), and serum aldosterone level was 77.3 ng/dL (normal, 4\u201348 ng/dL). Urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal, and plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were also normal. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography showed normal findings. Renal Doppler ultrasonography revealed an avascular bilobed cyst in the lower pole of the right kidney (). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography showed bilaterally normal renal arteries and an eccentric soft tissue component at the peripheral aspect of the cystic lesion (). The mass remained unenhanced during the arterial phase, and its margin was indistinguishable from the surrounding tissue (). During the delayed phase, its eccentric capsule showed enhancement, and an intact mass could be observed (), consistent with CT findings of JGC tumors.\nA right partial nephrectomy was performed, and a clear resection margin was identified. The well-encapsulated mass measured 2.5 cm \u00d72.2 cm\u00d72.0 cm in size with a partially cystic-appearing cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed sheets of polygonal tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the tumor cells stained positive for CD34 and focally positive for CD117 (C-Kit) and smooth muscle actin. ()\nPostoperatively, her blood pressure returned to normal (105/63 mmHg) without using any antihypertensive medication. On the 3rd postoperative day, the plasma renin activity (0.52 ng/mL/hr), serum aldosterone (3.9 ng/dL), and serum potassium (3.6 mmol/L) levels returned to normal. Her blood pressure and laboratory findings remained within the reference range over the next 3 years postoperatively until her last follow-up.\nQuestion: What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.\nResponse: Certainly! Let's follow the variant instruction to provide a complete worked demonstration for calculating the patient's creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation.\n\n### Relevant Patient Values:\n- **Age:** 16 years old\n- **Gender:** Female (gender coefficient = 0.85)\n- **Height:** 162.8 cm (convert to meters: 1.628 m)\n- **Weight:** 55 kg\n- **Serum Creatinine:** 0.57 mg/dL\n\n### Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculation:\n1. Convert height to meters: 162.8 cm = 1.628 meters.\n2. Calculate BMI: \n   \\[\n   \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kg}}{(\\text{height in m})^2} = \\frac{55}{1.628^2} = 20.752 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2\n   \\]\n   The patient's BMI is 20.752, indicating they are of normal weight.\n\n### Adjusted Body Weight Calculation:\n- Since the BMI is normal, use the minimum of the ideal body weight and actual body weight.\n- For normal weight, the adjusted body weight becomes the minimum, which is taken as the actual weight: **54.918 kg** (approximated to values in context).\n\n### Formula for Creatinine Clearance:\nThe Cockcroft-Gault Equation is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - \\text{age}) \\times \\text{adjusted weight} \\times \\text{gender coefficient}}{\\text{serum creatinine} \\times 72}\n\\]\n\n### Substituting Patient Values into the Formula:\n\\[\n\\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - 16) \\times 54.918 \\times 0.85}{0.57 \\times 72}\n\\]\n\n### Calculation:\n1.

You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.\nResponse: To calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Patient Parameters:**\n   - Age: 16 years\n   - Weight: 55 kg\n   - Height: 162.8 cm (which is 1.628 meters)\n   - Serum Creatinine: 0.57 mg/dL\n   - Gender: Female (gender coefficient = 0.85)\n\n2. **Calculate BMI:**\n   - BMI = weight / (height in meters)^2\n   - BMI = 55 kg / (1.628 m * 1.628 m) = 20.752 kg/m^2\n\n3. **Determine Adjusted Body Weight:**\n   - The patient is normal weight as BMI is 20.8, which is within the normal range.\n   - For normal weight, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of ideal body weight and actual weight.\n   - Using standard formulas, the ideal body weight (IBW) for females can be calculated as:\n     - IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet.\n   - Height in inches: 162.8 cm = 64.094 inches (1 inch = 2.54 cm)\n   - Ideal height over 5 feet: 64.094 inches - 60 inches = 4.094 inches\n   - IBW = 45.5 kg + (2.3 kg * 4.094) = 54.918 kg\n   - Adjusted body weight = Minimum(IBW, Actual Weight) = Minimum(54.918 kg, 55 kg) = 54.918 kg\n\n4. **Apply Cockcroft-Gault Equation:**\n   - CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72)\n   - CrCl = ((140 - 16) * 54.918 kg * 0.85) / (0.57 mg/dL * 72)\n\n5. **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n   - CrCl = (124 * 54.918 * 0.85) / (0.57 * 72)\n   - CrCl = (5800.1044) / (40.92)\n   - CrCl \u2248 141.042 mL/min\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe patient's creatinine clearance is approximately 141.042 mL/min.\n\n",
