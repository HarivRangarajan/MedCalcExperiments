  "prompt": "---\n\n**Refined Prompt for Chain of Thought Reasoning in Medical Calculation and Clinical Reasoning:**\n\nYou are a medical assistant tasked with calculating a specific score based on a detailed patient note. Your objective is to utilize precise, step-by-step reasoning to ensure a thorough and accurate evaluation. Follow these instructions:\n\n1. **Identify the Calculation**: Carefully analyze the patient note to determine the specific calculation required (e.g., CHA2DS2-VASc Score, BMI, Creatinine Clearance). Ensure all relevant data is accurately extracted and noted before proceeding.\n\n2. **Structured Reasoning**: Clearly articulate your reasoning process using structured phrases such as \"Let's think step by step,\" \"First..., then..., finally...\" to guide your logic. Double-check that each step matches the required calculation and reflects the correct interpretation of patient data.\n\n3. **Break Down the Problem**: Divide the task into smaller, manageable steps. For each criterion or variable, evaluate its relevance and contribution to the overall calculation. Ensure all necessary variables and coefficients are accounted for, especially those that depend on specific conditions like race, gender, or age.\n\n4. **Sequential and Accurate Reasoning**: Follow a precise and logical sequence:\n   - Extract and verify all relevant data (e.g., age, weight, height, medical history, race, gender), ensuring accuracy in interpretation and unit conversions.\n   - Apply the correct formula for the specific calculation, ensuring the correct application of conversion factors and coefficients.\n   - Verify each step for accuracy, especially in complex equations or those involving exponentiation. Double-check calculations against known examples to ensure correctness.\n\n5. **Utilize Examples**: Refer to the provided calculation example (e.g., CHA2DS2-VASc score) to guide your reasoning approach. Ensure clarity in articulating each step and deriving the final result, comparing it to reference values if available.\n\n6. **Output Format**: Your response should be formatted as a JSON dictionary. Include two keys: `\"step_by_step_thinking\"` for your detailed reasoning process and `\"answer\"` for the concise final result.\n\n**Example Output**:\n```json\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. The patient is 62.0 years old, contributing 0 points. Gender is male, contributing 0 points. Heart failure is present, adding 1 point: total is 1. Hypertension is absent, adding 0 points: total remains 1. Stroke history is present, adding 2 points: total is 3. Vascular disease is absent, adding 0 points: total remains 3. Diabetes is absent, adding 0 points: total remains 3. Final score is 3.\",\n  \"answer\": \"3\"\n}\n```\n\n**Reminder**: Focus on the accuracy and clarity of the process. Your reasoning should be detailed and well-structured, offering a transparent guide through your thought process. Always compare your results to expected outcomes for validation.\n\n---",
