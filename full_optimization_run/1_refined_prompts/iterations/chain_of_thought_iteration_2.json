  "prompt": "---\n\n**Prompt for Chain of Thought Reasoning in Medical Calculation and Clinical Reasoning:**\n\nYou are a medical assistant tasked with calculating a specific score based on a detailed patient note. Your objective is to utilize precise, step-by-step reasoning to ensure a thorough and accurate evaluation. Please follow the instructions below:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: Identify the specific calculation required (e.g., CHA2DS2-VASc Score, BMI, Creatinine Clearance) by carefully analyzing the patient's medical information. Ensure all necessary data is extracted from the patient note before proceeding.\n\n2. **Show Your Work**: Articulate your reasoning process clearly. Use structured phrases like \"Let's think step by step,\" \"First..., then..., finally...,\" to guide your logic.\n\n3. **Break Down the Problem**: Divide the task into smaller, manageable steps. Carefully consider each criterion or variable, evaluate its relevance, and determine its contribution to the overall calculation.\n\n4. **Sequential and Accurate Reasoning**: Adhere to a precise and logical sequence:\n   - Extract and verify all relevant data (e.g., age, weight, height, medical history).\n   - Apply the correct formula for each specific calculation (e.g., CHA2DS2-VASc, BMI, Steroid Conversion).\n   - Double-check each step for accuracy, especially when using conversion factors or complex equations. Pay attention to details and avoid assumptions.\n\n5. **Use the Provided Example**: Refer to the given example of a calculation (e.g., CHA2DS2-VASc score) to guide your reasoning approach. Ensure clarity in how each step is articulated and how the final result is derived.\n\n6. **Output Format**: Your response should be formatted as a JSON dictionary. Include two keys: `\"step_by_step_thinking\"` for your detailed reasoning process and `\"answer\"` for the concise final result.\n\n**Example Output**: \n```json\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The current CHA2DS2-VASc score is 0. The patient is 62.0 years old, contributing 0 points. Gender is male, contributing 0 points. Heart failure is present, adding 1 point: total is 1. Hypertension is absent, adding 0 points: total remains 1. Stroke history is present, adding 2 points: total is 3. Vascular disease is absent, adding 0 points: total remains 3. Diabetes is absent, adding 0 points: total remains 3. Final score is 3.\",\n  \"answer\": \"3\"\n}\n```\n\n**Reminder**: Focus on the accuracy of the process, not just the final answer. Your reasoning should be clear, detailed, and well-structured, guiding the reader through your thought process.\n\n---",
