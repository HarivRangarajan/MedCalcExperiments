This means that we increment the score by one and the current total will be 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe concentration of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 200.0 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 200.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 200.0 \u00b5mol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 200.0 \u00b5mol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.0002 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert from mol Pre-Operative Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.0002 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.023 g Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert 0.023 g of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.023 g Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 23.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 23.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/10.0 dL = 2.3 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 200.0 \u00b5mol Pre-Operative Creatinine/L converts to 2.3 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL.

Home medications included insulin glargine 25 units twice daily, gabapentin 800 mg three times daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, and metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily. He was treated for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the ED and was admitted for further management. The patient was found to be COVID positive on SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. He left against medical advice two days later.\nApproximately two weeks later, the patient presented with pleuritic chest pain associated with shortness of breath.

He reported that he had a 10 L paracentesis one year ago. He denied a history of coronary artery disease. The patient also reported that he used alcohol daily and was an active smoker. The patient\u2019s home medications included carvedilol, furosemide, spironolactone, atorvastatin, metformin, and albuterol. The patient\u2019s vital signs were within normal limits. Cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur at the cardiac apex, however, jugular venous pulsation was unable to be observed because of body habitus. On pulmonary exam, the patient\u2019s lungs were clear to auscultation in all lung fields. The patient had a distended abdomen with a positive fluid wave. The patient did not have lower extremity edema. His laboratory workup was notable for creatinine of 1 mg/dL, platelets of 33 x 103/mm3, INR of 1.1, albumin 3 g/dL, bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of >5000 pg/mL. The chest X-ray was unremarkable (Figure ).\nAt this point the etiology of dyspnea was thought to be related to congestive heart failure or ascites. The history of congestive heart failure, elevated BNP, and orthopnea supported congestive heart failure as the etiology of his dyspnea, but he had a normal lung exam, a normal chest X-ray, and no lower extremity edema. Meanwhile, the abdominal distension, positive fluid wave, and history of a therapeutic paracentesis suggested the presences of marked ascites. Large volume ascites can compress the diaphragm and cause orthopnea and dyspnea. However, management of ascites and congestive heart differ, and it was important to accurately distinguish the two (Table ) [].\nAn attending with five years of POCUS experience then performed POCUS to further assess the patient. Abdominal ultrasound revealed only moderate ascites in the suprapubic region (Video ,B), but no other significant fluid pockets were found in the bilateral lower compartments. This moderate volume of ascites made diaphragmatic compression as the etiology of his dyspnea less likely. To further characterize the etiology of the ascites, the probe was moved to the subxiphoid position to identify the IVC. His IVC was distended more than 2.1 cm with less than 50% collapsibility consistent with an elevated CVP > 10 mmHg (Video ,B) []. In order to characterize the etiology of this high CVP, the probe was then moved to the parasternal position to assess for cardiac pathology. In the parasternal long axis view, the left ventricle demonstrated normal ejection fraction, but the right ventricle was severely dilated, and a moderate pericardial effusion was observed (Video ). In the parasternal short-axis view, the right ventricle was observed to be larger than the left ventricle, with septal flattening during diastole suggesting severe right ventricular dysfunction (Video ).\nA paracentesis revealed 366 x 103/mm3 white blood cells with 61% monocytes and macrophages. The serum-ascites albumin gradient was 1.5, suggestive of portal hypertension. Finally, the ascites total protein was >2.5 g/dL, which confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac ascites. He was started on IV diuresis and had a 20-pound weight loss over the subsequent seven days with resolution of his shortness of breath and orthopnea.\nThe severe right heart dysfunction found on POCUS prompted a workup for pulmonary hypertension. A transthoracic echo confirmed the findings on POCUS including left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%-60%.

She denied any chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, or leg swelling. She quit smoking 36 years ago and has no family history of early cardiovascular diseases. She has a very distant cardiac work-up years ago, including a stress test and an echocardiogram, which the patient reported were unremarkable. Vital signs prior to the test were a blood pressure of 140/78, heart rate of 80, and a respiratory rate of 14. Physical exam was unremarkable except for a systolic ejection murmur that was graded II/VI at the base. EKG was at baseline with a normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and occasional premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).\nThe patient underwent an exercise stress test using the Bruce protocol and was able to complete stage 1 with exercise for three minutes at a speed of 1.7 mph and a 10% incline. The test was terminated due to dyspnea and fatigue without chest pain. She reached a heart rate of 141 beats per minute which was 98% of predicted for her age. She accomplished 4.5 metabolic equivalents of exertion. With exercise, she had occasional atrial premature complexes and PVCs with a ventricular couplet in recovery. She started to notice tightness in her chest. Her peak blood pressure at the time was 218/90.\nThe patient was transferred onto a stretcher, and an IV line was started. She was given sublingual nitroglycerin, 325 mg of aspirin to chew, and one 5 mg IV push of metoprolol tartrate. She then received nitroglycerin paste and metoprolol tartrate IV every 5 min for two more doses. At that time, her EKG on the stretcher showed ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 with ST depressions in leads III, aVF, and V1-V3 consistent with a lateral wall evolving myocardial infarction (). She was transferred urgently to our institution for cardiac catheterization.\nThe patient underwent an emergent cardiac catheterization with left ventriculography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) within 2 hours after onset of symptoms. Troponin-I levels prior to the catheterization increased to 11.17 (normal less than 0.05 ng/ml). The rest of the laboratories were within normal limits including a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. Coronary angiography showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease (pLAD 40%) and highly tortuous coronary arteries. IVUS of the proximal LAD revealed a minimal lumen area of 5.2mm2, and no ruptured plaques. Left ventriculogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and severe mid-cavitary hypokinesis with basal and apical hyperkinesis (Figures and ). To our knowledge, this is the first case of treadmill exercise testing-triggered mid-left ventricular ballooning variant of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, whereby obstructive epicardial CAD and ruptured plaques were excluded with angiography and IVUS, respectively.\nThe patient was started on medical management with standard therapy for heart failure. A follow-up echocardiogram was done two days after the event which redemonstrated mid-left ventricular ballooning, with an improved LVEF of 35%. The patient remained asymptomatic during the course of her hospitalization and troponin levels trended down from a postcardiac catheterization peak of 16.06 ng/ml.

Physical exam was notable for marked facial stubble subsequent to shaving (Figure ) and diffuse terminal hair across her chest and abdomen. There was also some regression in the patient\u2019s hairline (Figure ). There was no acanthosis nigricans present. Physical exam also revealed unique changes (Figure ) in 8 of her fingernails (described below), however the toenails were normal. Cliteromegaly measuring 2 cm was observed on pelvic exam. The remainder of the physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory studies showed an extremely high total testosterone and androstenedione level at 742 ng/dl (reference range: < 62 ng/dL) and 339.0 ng/dL (20-75 ng/dL) respectively. Serum DHEA sulfate 174.2 mcg/dL (<15 - 157 mcg/dL), TSH 1.6 \u03bcIU/mL (0.5 - 4.70 \u03bcIU/mL), calcium 9.9 mg/dL (8.8 - 10.3 mg/dL), and parathyroid hormone levels 44.2 pg/ml (11 - 54 pg/ml) were all within normal reference range. The serum estradiol level was slightly elevated at 54 pg/mL (0 to 30 pg/mL; postmenopausal) (Table ). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 3.5 cm left ovarian mass with normal appearing adrenal glands. This was subsequently confirmed by ultrasound which revealed an enlarged hypoechoic left ovarian mass of 3.6 \u00d7 3.5\u00d7 3.6 cm, and normal right ovary measuring 1.9 \u00d7 2.1 \u00d7 1.7 cm. Her uterus was normal in size, measuring 5.8 \u00d7 2.6 \u00d7 4.8 cm. But, the endometrial lining was heterogeneous and thickened, measuring at 9 mm. Preoperative and intraoperative consultation with our gynecological oncology team was conducted. The patient was referred for surgical removal of the ovarian mass. Laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal washings, and dilation and curettage were performed. At the time of surgery, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterine cutterings were sent for intra-operative frozen section pathology consultation. The frozen section of the left ovary revealed features of a \u201csex cord stromal tumor\u201d. The right ovary was atrophic measuring 1.9 \u00d7 2.1 \u00d7 1.7 cm. The frozen section analysis of uterine curettings revealed no signs of atypia or malignancy. Lymph node dissection was not warranted based on preoperative and intraoperative evaluation as well as frozen section histological consultation showing a well-contained lesion within the ovary.\nThe final pathology report revealed a left ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor measuring 2.5\u00d7 2.0\u00d71.4 cm. The tumor was composed primarily of Leydig cells, without well-formed Sertoli cell tubules or cord (Figure A). High-power (40\u00d7) fields revealed primarily sheets and aggregates of Leydig cells in a dense fibrous stroma (Figure B). Sertoli cells were difficult to identify. Immuno-histochemical stains for Keratin 8/18 or CAM 5.2 staining was mixed, strong to weak (Figure C). Both Keratin AE1/AE3 (Figure D) and Wilms tumor gene(WT-1) stains revealed negative to weak staining of Leydig cells and were positive for those considered as Sertoli cells. Negative staining of all cells for Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) (Figure E) and diffuse, positive staining of all the cells for CD99, Calretinin, and alpha Inhibin, (Figure F) was observed, consistent with the pattern for both Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. Peritoneal washings were negative for tumor cells. The patient had a normal postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital on the first postoperative day in good condition.\nThe patient returned for a series of postoperative follow up visits. The first was one week post-surgery and then every three months for a total of one full year.\nInterestingly, careful exam of this patient pre-operatively revealed unique fingernail changes. The patient stated that she observed these changes months prior to presentation in the clinic. The nails looked mostly flat with significant curved concave spoon shaped ends. This was observed in most (8/10) fingers. The changes were particularly impressive in the index and middle fingers on both hands (Figure ). An extensive review of the literature did not reveal similar findings in SLCT cases reported before nor any other female endocrinopathy. It is possible that previous cases of SLCT-induced hyperandrogenemia may have overlooked these nail findings. The only condition that leads to similar findings is iron-deficiency anemia. Although patient hemoglobin levels were always within the normal reference range, detailed iron-deficiency anemia work up was performed (Table ) and was all within normal limits. Importantly, the fingernail changes started to gradually reverse after the curative surgery and normalization of patient hormonal profile (Table ). The post-surgery reversal of nail changes (Figure ) led us to confidently conclude that the nail signs were secondary to hyperandrogenemia. As this was the first association between fingernail changes and hyperandrogenemia, we propose these changes to be named the \u201cAl-Hendy\u201d nail sign.\nSince androgens mediate all their cellular biological effects through its androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear steroid receptor superfamily [], we assumed that the fingernail area must express AR. We then decided to examine this concept ourselves. After appropriate IRB approval from Meharry Medical College, we collected nail bed tissues from healthy female volunteers and processed them for AR immunohistochemistry as described in Materials and Methods Section.", "Question": "What is the patient's HEART score?", "LLM Answer": "2", "LLM Explanation": "The HEART score is used to evaluate chest pain in the emergency department, focusing on History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin levels. \\n1.

He had been residing within the USA for the last year and working as a long-distance truck driver. The patient described the pain as a heaviness which sometimes felt sharp and lasted several hours long. He had been experiencing this pain for two days and the pain usually started in the morning and worsened with exertion. On the day of presentation, he rated the pain 9 out of 10 on the severity scale and denied any symptoms of shortness of breath or pleuritic type chest discomfort associated with respiration. He was administered aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin; the nitroglycerin did not relieve his chest pain and his presentation was worrisome for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was completely afebrile and vital signs were stable. Physical examination only revealed some elicited pain with range of motion of his left arm. He denied any alcohol use, tobacco use, or illicit drug use and denied any family history of cardiac disease.\nInvestigations\nHis ECG showed 1 to 2 mm ST elevations in lead I and aVL, ST depression in aVR, mild J-point elevation, and T-wave inversion in leads II, III and aVF (Figure ). His ECG was not entirely convincing of STEMI and his troponins were found to be elevated at 5.97 ng/mL and eventually peaked to 6.24 ng/mL. He was taken urgently for cardiac catheterization and it revealed completely normal coronaries so no intervention was performed (Figures -). There was no evidence of myocardial bridging either.\nGiven his profession of being a long-distance truck driver and traveling, he was tested via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) and was found to be positive. Subsequently, a CT scan was done to rule out pulmonary embolism as the cause of his chest pain since SARS-CoV-2 virus induces a hypercoagulable and thrombotic state in individuals []. CT scan was negative for any pulmonary embolism and revealed clear lungs without any typical respiratory characteristics of COVID-19. This was followed up with a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and it revealed no wall motion abnormalities and a completely normal ejection fraction at 55%-60% and no evidence of pericarditis or pericardial effusion.\nThe patient's blood work was consistent with biomarkers typically identified with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2): his d-dimer was elevated at 0.96 mcg/mL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) elevated at 44 mm/hr, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevated at 926 units/L, procalcitonin was negative at 0.04 ng/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) elevated at 3.3 mg/dL, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevated at 366 units/L, amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) elevated at 379 pg/mL, and mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevated at 89 units/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevated at 152 units/L []. COVID-19 is commonly associated with elevated ferritin levels since ferritin is an acute phase reactant but interestingly, in our patient, the ferritin was within normal limits at 243 ng/mL [].\nDifferential diagnosis\nInitially, STEMI was at the top of the differential given that he had an equivocal ECG and worsening chest pain. With cardiac catheterization revealing normal coronary arteries and no lesion inducing stenosis, myocarditis became the top differential given that he had evidence of myocardial injury with the troponin leak. Cardiac catheterization also ruled out any concern for myocardial bridging as the source of his chest pain.\nManagement and follow-up\nThe patient was managed conservatively during his hospitalization. Interestingly, after his cardiac catheterization, his chest pain resolved and the pain was well-controlled with acetaminophen alone. He was not on any medications prior to admission and was discharged in a stable condition with acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were avoided for the concern of exacerbating myocardial inflammation due to COVID-19.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atypical ST segment elevation and T wave inversion in lateral chest leads (Lead V4, Lead V5, and Lead V6). Initial rapid troponin-t-test was inconclusive, but repeat one after 12 hours of first test was negative. Sputum for acid fast bacilli and Gram stain was negative, and pyogenic culture of sputum showed no growth. Chest X-ray posteroanterior (PA view) showed cardiothoracic ratio was more than 0.5; that is, size of the cardiac silhouette was increased, but lung parenchyma was normal. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of thorax showed a large, nonhomogenous mass lesion in right lower lobe which invaded the left atrium and was compressing the adjacent ventricular walls (). There was also mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed discrete clusters of malignant epithelial cells which showed nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, pale cytoplasm, and ill-defined cell boundary\u2014suggestive of non-small-cell carcinoma, possibly squamous cell variety (). FNAC of left sided supraclavicular lymph nodes showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Sputum for malignant cell was negative and fibre optic bronchoscopy did not show any abnormality.

Postintubation he was transferred to the medical ICU for presumed septic shock.\nOn arrival to the ICU after initial stabilization of the patient a diagnostic paracentesis was performed in order to obtain culture for possible SBP. An appropriate pocket of fluid was visualized in the right lower abdominal quadrant. Approximately five ml of bloody ascites was aspirated. Concurrently, repeat lab results reported a hemoglobin level of 4.4 g/dl and an arterial blood gas with a lactate of 12.92 mmol/liter.

At the same time the patient's girlfriend arrived to the hospital and stated that the patient had complained of falling in the bathroom earlier that day. General surgery recommended angiogram to locate the source of suspected intraabdominal bleeding. Interventional radiology was contacted for emergent angiogram to evaluate for a hepatic or splenic hemorrhage.

We followed up at interval of 2\u20133 months after the hepatectomy. During post-surgery follow-up, abdominal ultrasonography detected a 36-mm hypoechoic tumor in segment 7 of the liver.

Subsequently, abortion surgery was performed at 21 weeks and 2 days of pregnancy, followed by subsegmentectomy of liver segment 7 under general and epidural anesthesia 6 days later. Mental care for the patient was provided by obstetricians, surgeons, and nurses before and after abortion. After mobilizing the right lobe of the liver, we identified the Glissonian pedicle (G) 7 and injected indigo carmine under US guidance to mark the perfusion area. Thereafter, hepatic resection was initiated using an ultrasonic dissector under the Pringle\u2019s maneuver. After identifying the G7, a clamp test was performed to reconfirming the ischemic area before ligating and cutting it. We continued hepatic resection along the RHV, exfoliated a tumor within the vicinity of a root of the RHV, and subsequently completed subsegmentectomy of liver segment 7 (Fig. ). The surgery lasted 274 min, with an estimated blood loss of 940 mL. Macroscopically, the whitish tumor with a maximum diameter of 4.0 cm was simple nodular type and showed expansive growth (Fig. ). A pathological diagnosis of moderately differentiated HCC, grade II, eg, fc (\u2212), sf (+), s0, vp0, vv0, b0, im0, and sm (\u2212) was thereafter established. Tumor cells showed a moderate degree of atypia, as well as a cord-like or pseudoglandular arrangement associated with abundant eosinophilic vesicles and a rich nucleoplasm. Given the good postoperative course, without particular complications, the patient was discharged 10 days after surgery.

For the past few years the patient reported experiencing intermittent chest pains at night. In addition to the chest pain, the patient developed pyrexia and perspiration beginning a week before admission. He initially visited another hospital for worsening symptoms where examination found abnormal electrocardiography results (the ST elevation in leads aVL and V1 to V6), leukocytosis, and abnormal liver function tests. Echocardiography revealed a decreased cardiac output with regional wall motion abnormality. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) results showed hepatic parenchymal abnormality and a tumor on the left adrenal gland. The patient was transferred to the reporting hospital with these results.\nSeven years prior to presentation the patient had been diagnosed with hypertension and was put on antihypertensive medication, but remained poorly controlled over the 3 years prior to presentation. He was also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 8 years ago and has been treated with hypoglycemic agents, but his blood sugar was poorly controlled. There was no other medical history.\nOn admission, his blood pressure was 140/90 mm Hg with a pulse rate of 66 beats per minute, was breathing at a rate of 20 times per minute, and had a body temperature of 36.8\u2103. He had clear consciousness without signs of conjunctival pallor, scleral jaundice, dehydration, and absent dilatation of the jugular vein. On chest auscultation breath sounds were clear without wheezing or crackles detected. Cardiac auscultation revealed a heartbeat that was regular without murmur. On examining the abdomen, bowel sounds seemed reduced and the right upper abdomen had slight but not significant tenderness. No masses were detected on abdomen. No limb edema was seen.\nTwo days prior to admission, the patient had been tested in another hospital. Blood tests resulted as follows: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 444 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 469 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 1,153 IU/L, white blood cell count 50,000/\u00b5L, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative, anti-HBsAb positive, antihepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibody (Ab) negative, antihepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) Ab negative, and anti-HAV IgG Ab positive. On the day of admission to our hospital, the blood test results were as follows: hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, white blood cell count 59,360/\u00b5L, platelet count 244,000/\u00b5L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 4 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein 3.446 mg/L, blood urea nitrogen 22.7 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.76 mg/dL, serum calcium 7.2 mg/dL, inorganic phosphorous 2.0 mg/dL, sodium 134 mmol/L, and potassium 4.4 mmol/L. The results also showed that total protein was 5.5 g/dL, albumin was 2.7 g/dL, AST 156 IU/L and ALT 317 IU/L, ALP 289 IU/L, and total bilirubin 1.05 mg/dL. Hemoglobin A1c was 10.7%. At fasting, C-peptide was 0.40 ng/mL (range, 0.48 to 3.3), and 2 hours after a meal it was 0.66 ng/mL. Lactate dehydrogenase was 1,240 IU/L. Creatine kinase MB and troponin-T were found to be 5.99 ng/mL (range, 0.6 to 6.3) and 0.073 ng/mL (range, 0.0 to 0.1), respectively.\nChest X-ray found no abnormal finding. Abdominal CT at another hospital detected several small-sized and low attenuation lesions on both lobes of the liver, and a 5\u00d75-cm-sized tumor enhanced unevenly on the left adrenal gland ().\nElectrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm with T wave inversion and QT interval prolongation observed in leads II and V1 to V6 (). Although the cardiac ejection fraction was 69%, echocardiography detected severely hypokinetic wall motion of mid-left ventricle sparing basal and apical wall motions.\nThe tumor on the left adrenal gland was tested for hormones. The results of 24 hours urinalysis were as follows: vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) 33.93 mg/day (range, 0 to 8.0), metanephrines 20.45 mg/day (range, 0 to 1.3), epinephrine 2,034 \u00b5g/day (range, 0 to 40), norepinephrine 978 \u00b5g/day (range, 0 to 80), serum epinephrine 1,221 pg/mL (range, 0 to 120), and serum norepinephrine 778 pg/mL (range, 100 to 410). Other tests including aldosterone, plasma renin activity, and cortisol were all normal. On 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan examination, uptake of the radioactive isotope was increased in the left adrenal gland, but no other lesions were found ().\nBased on the examination results above, the patient was diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma on the left adrenal gland. On the 12th day of admission oral phenoxybenzamine administration was started, and blood pressure was followed after having ceased all previous antihypertensives. The dosage of phenoxybenzamine was increased to 35 mg/day. After 19 days of administration, resection of the left adrenal gland was performed under laparoscope. The size of the resected tumor was 5\u00d75 cm, and the surface was a mixture of a hemorrhagic and a cystic lesion. The tissue pathological examination showed the tumor cells with eosinophillic cytoplasm and polygonal shape surrounded by mesenchyma of vasculature on H&E staining, while immunohistochemical stains of chromogranin, synaptophysin, and S-100 immunoperoxidase staining revealed the proper findings to diagnose pheochromocytoma as positive (). Thirteen days after tumor resection a panel of endocrine tests was performed to follow-up on the pheochromocytoma. A 24 hours urinalysis showed a VMA of 6.51 mg/day with metanephrines at 0.61 mg/day, epinephrine at <5 \u00b5g/day, norepinephrine at 101.48 \u00b5g/day, serum epinephrine at <15 pg/mL, and serum norepinephrine at 536.60 pg/mL (). When first admitted, the patient had uncontrolled blood pressure even with amlodipine 10 mg and irbesartan 150 mg plus 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. However, when discharged, the patient had controlled blood pressure with a reduced dosage of antihypertensives consisting of amlodipine 10 mg and irbesartan 150 mg.\nPrior to his admission to the outside hospital, the patient had no history of new drug administration that might cause liver function failure. He also had no history of drinking and had a normal body weight (body mass index 23 kg/m2). A panel for hepatic viral disease (hepatitis B virus, HCV, HAV) was negative, and no abnormality was found through immunological testing (antismooth muscle, antinuclear, antimitochondria antibody), or screening for genetic diseases (plasma iron parameters, ceruloplasmin, Cu). This led to the challenge of finding a clear cause for the liver function failure. The liver function improved with conservative treatment, and had resolved by the time phenoxybenzamine was administered (). On the 22nd day after left adrenal gland resection, AST and ALT had normalized at 23 and 25 IU/L, respectively (), and normal liver function test remained within normal limits at 80 days after surgery.\nAfter admission to our hospital, the patient's leukocytosis continued, and follow-up tests were performed to examine for secondary causes such as blood diseases, infection, and pheochromocytoma. On the fourth day of phenoxybenzamine administration the white blood cell count had recovered to 5,900/\u00b5L and continued to be within the normal range even after surgery ().\nEchocardiography indicated cardiac ejection fraction of 78% on the 15th day after admission (fourth day of phenoxybenzamine administration), and no left ventricle wall motion abnormalities were observed.\nOn admission the patient was administered insulin and metformin, but the range of blood glucose fluctuation was wide. However, after surgery blood glucose levels returned to the normal range without the previously administered medications. Previously suppressed C-peptide secretion was recovered 3 days after surgery. On the 80th day after surgery, the hemoglobin A1c was measured found to be 5.7% ().", "Question": "What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?", "LLM Answer": "1.497", "LLM Explanation": "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * sqrt(ALT)), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.\\nThe patient's age is 49 years.\\nThe patient's concentration of AST is 156 IU/L.\\nThe patient's concentration of ALT is 317 IU/L.\\nThe patient's concentration of platelets is 244,000/\u00b5L.

About two years prior to his initial clinic visit, he reportedLy had an episode of jaundice after taking terbinafine, but it had resolved spontaneously after three months. He denied any recent use of prescription medication, herbal medication, alcohol or illicit drugs. There was no family history of recurrent cholestatic disorder or liver disease. Physical examination was significant for marked jaundice and scleral icterus but there was neither sign nor stigmata of chronic liver disease. Laboratory tests showed white blood count 3300/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 13 g/dL, platelets 186 000/\u03bcL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 91 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 96 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 712 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) 643 U/L, total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dL, albumin 4.3 g/dL, total protein 7.7 g/dL, international normalized ratio 1 and creatinine 1.1. Hepatitis A, B and C serology was negative. Iron studies, ceruloplasmin, alpha 1-anitrypsin, serum immunoglobulins and protein electrophoresis were normal. Anti-nuclear (ANA), anti-smooth muscle, anti-mitochondrial (AMA) and anti-liver-kidney microsome antibodies were negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilation or cholelithiasis. Magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) revealed normal pancreatic duct, common hepatic duct, common bile duct without ductal dilation and normal liver. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy did not show evidence of inflammatory bowel disease. Further work-up with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) revealed normal pancreatic and biliary system, without evidence of any large- or small-duct disease (). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 600 mg daily was administered for his symptomatic cholestasis. In six-month and one-year follow-up visits, there was no improvement in his liver enzymes (); however, his liver synthetic function remained intact and there was no evidence of hepatic decompensation. Given persistent elevation of liver enzymes, percutaneous liver biopsy was performed in 2013. This demonstrated chronic biliary disease with duct injury, duct loss in at least 4 out of 15 portal tracts, prominent cholestasis and mild periportal fibrosis (). Work-up for sarcoidosis showed normal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level, while mediastinal lymph node biopsy was unrevealing.\nThree months later, the patient was admitted to the hospital for worsening jaundice and pruritus. His liver enzymes were elevated to ALT 167 U/L, AST 221 U/L, ALP 1726 U/L and total bilirubin 14.9 mg/dL. MRCP revealed under-distended, poorly visualized intrahepatic ducts and non-dilated common bile duct. Subsequent ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy demonstrated normal cholangiogram with minimal narrowing of the intrahepatic ducts, without evidence of changes. On discharge, his liver enzymes improved to ALT 39 U/L, AST 40 U/L, ALP 637 U/L, total bilirubin 10.8 mg/dL, and UDCA was increased to 1200 mg daily. In subsequent clinic visits, his liver enzymes were found to be persistently elevated to ALP 1500\u20132000 U/L and total bilirubin 20\u201330 mg/dL, without any clinical signs of hepatic decompensation ().\nLeading differential diagnoses were small biliary duct etiologies including AMA-negative primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and idiopathic adulthood ductopenia (IAD). However, the patient's gender was unusual for PBC, while extreme elevation of bilirubin and ALP without concomitant liver failure was not consistent with PSC and PBC. In addition, he did not respond to empirical treatment for autoimmune cholangiopathy, and had a negative sarcoidosis work-up.

The medical history of patient revealed that he was diagnosed as a hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier about 20 years earlier, but was lost to follow up. The patient was not a heavy drinker or smoker. There was no significant family history. On physical examination, a palpable and hard mass was noted in the right pelvic area. Hepatomegaly, liver masses, and ascites were absent. Initial laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 4,830/\u00b5L, hemoglobin 15.2 g/dL, platelets 138,000/\u00b5L, total protein 7.8 g/dL, albumin 4.4 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 31 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 35 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.0 mg/dL, alkaline phosphate 98 IU/L, prothrombin time 14 second (INR 1.21), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 15.01 ng/mL, and protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) 864 mAU/mL. Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were positive. Hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), HBV-DNA with polymerase chain reaction, and serological markers of hepatitis C were negative. He belonged to Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A.\nFor evaluation of the pelvic mass, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed. They demonstrated a 13\u00d710 cm expansile mass that involved the right iliac bone (). The patient underwent an incisional biopsy with the impression of a malignant bone tumor. However, on pathological examination, the tumor was composed of polygonal cells with ample cytoplasm and trabecular pattern. In immunohistochemical stains, these tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), hepatocyte paraffin 1 (HepPar1), and glypican-3, which confirmed the diagnosis of HCC (). Tumor cells were negative for CD56, chromogranin A and synaptophysin, which are the markers of neuroendocrine differentiation. To find the primary focus, abdominal CT, MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) scans and angiography were performed. However, no tumor was found in the liver in these radiologic examinations.\nWe diagnosed this case as an isolated metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone without the presence of a primary cancer in the liver. Surgical resection of the tumor was recommended, but the patient refused an operation because of old age and the large size of the tumor. Instead, we decided to treat him with combined modalities. He started radiotherapy in the pelvic area with a total dose of 5,100 cGy in 17 fractions. One week after the end of radiotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed in the metastatic HCC of the pelvic bone via the right internal iliac artery (adriamycin 50 mg and 20 mL of lipiodol). Then, the patient was treated with five cycles of systemic chemotherapy based on 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, 1,000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3) and cisplatin (90 mg/m2 on day 2 every 4 weeks). After the completion of chemotherapy, the tumor became almost necrotic. The AFP and PIVKA-II levels decreased to the normal ranges (2.85 ng/mL and 28 mAU/mL, respectively). As the treatment resulted in near complete regression of the tumor, the patient underwent close follow-up without chemotherapy. However, 12 months after chemotherapy, a CT scan revealed multiple lung metastases in both lungs with increasing AFP and PIVKA-II levels (182 ng/mL and 38 mAU/mL, respectively). He was treated with two cycles of systemic chemotherapy with the same regimen (5-FU 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 2 and 3 and cisplatin 90 mg/m2 on day 2). After two cycles of chemotherapy, the patient refused additional chemotherapy and we provided him with supportive care thereafter.

The \"hemoptysis\" had started 3 hours prior after sudden coughing and was described by his wife as very dark in color. Our electronic medical record indicated that he had attended our outpatient hepatology clinic regularly for hepatitis B virus\u2013related HCC with a huge 20-cm mass in the right hemiliver, which was diagnosed 5 years ago; he received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) twice for the mass at the time of diagnosis and no further invasive procedure was performed for the past years; follow-up abdominal imaging regularly at 6-month interval showed no evidence of tumor rupture and no change of necrotic mass until recently (). Current medications included sorafenib and entecavir, which he had taken for the past 5 years. He denied any history of aspiration, vomiting, hematemesis, or melena; the last esophagogastroduodenoscopy did not show presence of varix a year ago. Recently, he had intermittent right flank discomfort and a low-grade fever without chills for a year. He was a never-smoker and denied history of asthma.\nOn arrival, he was in acute respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute and was receiving oxygen at the rate of 10 L/min via a facial mask in the ambulance. Other vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 138/91 mm Hg, pulse rate 111 beats per minute, temperature 36.4\u2103, and oxygen saturation 90% using the full facial oxygen mask. Bilateral whole-lung wheezing was dominant and right-sided crackles were heard upon auscultation. There was no visible blood in the oral cavity. The results of the initial arterial blood gas analyses during full facial oxygen mask administration were pH 7.4, pCO2 30 mm Hg, pO2 79 mm Hg, and HCO3 20.4 mmol/L. After administering an inhaled bronchodilator with a systemic steroid, intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg, his oxygen demand gradually decreased to 3 L/min administered via a nasal cannula.\nIn order to find the possible source of the \"hemoptysis,\" computed tomography (CT) of the chest with angiography was performed, which showed a new area of consolidation in the right basal lung suggesting necrotizing pneumonia (). Otherwise, no definite hypertrophied bronchial artery was seen and there was no possible bleeding focus.\nBlood tests showed marked leukocytosis (28,690/mL, 78% segmented neutrophils) with significantly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP, 28.11 mg/dL) and lactic acid (4.3 mmol/L).\nThere was no change in the hemoglobin level from his baseline (12.8 g/dL). His hematocrit was 38.3% and the platelet count was normal (252\u00d7103/\u00b5L). The blood urea nitrogen was not elevated (15 mg/dL); serum sodium was 134 mmol/L and the serum glucose level was 158 mg/dL. Liver function tests were also within the usual range (aspartate aminotransferase, 35 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase, 40 IU/L; total bilirubin, 1.1 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; and prothrombin time, 64% [patient's baseline, 69%]).\nTreatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 6 hours and levofloxacin 750 mg daily was initiated immediately and the patient was admitted to the general ward. Given the relatively mild pneumonia severity index (risk class III, 89 points) and radiologic extent of pneumonia, inflammatory markers including leukocyte count and CRP were persistently highly elevated. There were no improvements in his clinical signs (respiratory symptoms, cough, dark-colored sputum, and wheezing) or X-ray while continuing antibiotics. There was no bacterial growth on the initial blood and sputum cultures. A sputum acid fast stain for tuberculosis was negative. The urinary pneumococcal antigen test was also negative. On hospitalization day 5, his dyspnea worsened and the oxygen demand increased up to 6 L/min via nasal cannula.\nOn hospital day 7, the patient developed type 2 respiratory failure (pH, 7.13; pCO2, 105 mm Hg; pO2, 123 mm Hg; HCO3, 25.2 mmol/L) despite the use of noninvasive ventilator support overnight. Intubation was performed, and immediately afterwards, a massive volume of dark-brown secretions with a consistency like anchovy-paste was expectorated via the endotracheal tube. We thought that it was very strange because his mental status had been alert and there was no preceding aspiration event. Since the huge hepatic mass had been compressing the right lung, we considered the possibility of a connection and reviewed the initial CT scan with the Division of Thoracic Imaging, Department of Radiology. Indeed, a possible communication tract between the hepatic mass and the right middle bronchus was discovered (). A sputum smear was performed which showed numerous neutrophils and dyskeratotic cells.\nThe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit to receive mechanical ventilation and the antibiotic therapy was changed to intravenous meropenem 1 g every 8 hours. Bronchoscopy performed the next day showed obstruction of the right middle bronchus with a large amount of thick brown secretions. No overt defect was seen. After toileting, the patient was successfully extubated.\nIn the ward, he continued to expectorate dark brown sputum despite improvement in the pneumonic consolidation, laboratory findings, and oxygen demand. After 12 days of intravenous antibiotics to cover necrotizing pneumonia and continued administration of sorafenib and entecavir, the chest X-ray showed slightly improved consolidation and a sign of an air-fluid level under the right diaphragm.\nOn the 25th hospital day, a repeat CT scan was taken, which showed simultaneous disappearance of the pneumonic consolidation and the necrotic fluid within the hepatic mass (). A fistula connecting the two sides was seen (). The patient's history was carefully recorded again and the patient and his wife confirmed that there had not been any blood in the sputum at any time; it had always been brown and like the anchovy-paste (). It turned out that an intern in the ED had initially recorded it as \"hemoptysis.\" A sputum smear was performed again and showed numerous bilirubin castlike objects ().\nConsidering the short life expectancy due to HCC, he and his family did not want to receive further invasive procedures or surgery. While continuing antibiotics and tapering the steroid, the patient received inpatient rehabilitation and was successful discharged.

Physical examination and initial vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.0\u2103; pulse rate, 66 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and blood pressure, 140/90 mmHg. Her height and body weight were 158 cm and 66 kg. She had a 10-year history of hypertension with good blood pressure control from oral Valsartan (40 mg/day). Her familial history was unremarkable. Laboratory examinations showed a low white blood cell count of 3,920/\u00b5L, a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/L, and a platelet count of 124,000/\u00b5L. The liver function test results were as follows: serum aspartate transaminase: 14 U/L; alanine transaminase: 19 U/L; alkaline phosphatase: 88 IU/L; gamma-glutamyl transferase: 16 U/L; total bilirubin: 4.05 \u00b5mol/L; albumin, 35.7 g/L; and international normalized ratio: 0.93. CA 19-9 and \u03b1-FP were assayed for a malignancy workup, with results of 16.35 U/mL and 2.61 ng/mL, respectively. The results for viral markers including HBV surface antigen and anti-HCV were negative. Abdominal CT revealed an atrophic left lobar and dilated bile duct with the middle hepatic vein close to the cystic lesion (). Abdominal MRCP revealed irregular intrahepatic bile duct dilatation (IHBDD) of the left lobe with the left hepatic duct obstructed, while the common bile duct and right intrahepatic bile duct were normal (). However, we found that the irregular cystic dilatation of the bile duct was limited to the left liver and contained stones inside the cysts. No obvious abnormal dilated bile duct was found in the right liver. The common bile duct and the hepatic duct were normal, and no obvious dilatation was found. This patient was diagnosed with Caroli disease (type V). The surgical indication for the patient was explicit. However, the treatment prescription required consideration of the cystic wall being adjacent to the middle hepatic vein, the left hepatic atrophy and structure disorder, and the observation that the left hepatic vein was not visible. Although complete resection of the cysts may be a curative treatment for unilobar Caroli disease, this treatment was impossible for this patient due to the close adherence of the middle hepatic vein to the cystic wall. Therefore, we decided to perform laparoscopic left LR for the patient, while preserving a partial cystic wall close to the middle hepatic vein.\nThe standard laparoscopic equipment used to perform laparoscopic hepatectomy included a 30\u00b0 5-mm laparoscope, a hook dissector, 5-mm laparoscopic forceps, a 5-mm atraumatic grasper, a 10-mm GIA (Johnson & Johnson Medical, Shanghai, China), 5-mm harmonic (Johnson & Johnson Medical) and 10-mm locking pliers.\nThe conventional fully laparoscopic multiport approach was adopted. The patient was placed in a supine position, and the surgeon stood on the right side. Under general anesthesia, five 5- to 10-mm incisions were made in a \u201cU\u201d configuration. Division of the liver parenchyma was performed with Harmonic or Endo-GIA. Large pedicles were stapled or clipped.\nUpon surgical exploration, the left lobe of the liver was found to be atrophied, and the right liver had developed compensatory hyperplasia with a red-brown and smooth surface. However, the left liver lobe was severely adherent. We gradually dissected the adhesion using harmonic pliers and exposed the atrophic left lobe (5 cm \u00d7 6 cm \u00d7 2 cm). The gallbladder was approximately 7 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 2 cm in size and was filled with bile and gallstones. Through intraoperative exploration, we confirmed the diagnosis of Caroli disease, limited to the left lobe of the liver. We obtained a biopsy from the edge of the lesion and performed a rapid intraoperative pathological examination to exclude malignant tumor. We then decided to perform a laparoscopic left liver and gallbladder resection. The difficulty was that the lesion was close to the middle hepatic vein. We opened the cysts and resected most of the lesion while retaining part of cystic wall close to the middle hepatic vein. After laparoscopic left half-liver and gallbladder resection, the liver lesion tissue and gallbladder were removed completely from the abdominal cavity. Histopathologic findings showed congenital dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, confirming the preoperative diagnosis of Caroli disease (). Histopathology of the resected specimen revealed large, cystic dilations of the large intrahepatic bile ducts. This patient was seen regularly every 3 months at the outpatient department.

The result was negative. Respiratory secretions were not collected for microbiological diagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of right basal pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute chronic liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury was established. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Anti-inflammatory steroid, antibiotic, antihypertensive, oxygen therapy was initiated. The patient died 17 h after presentation.\nThe necropsy was performed 12 h after death. Necropsy exam revealed the following: about 1700 mL of serous fluid in the right pleural cavity, with gray deposits, which were also present focally on the surface of the right pleura, and about 500 mL of serous citrine fluid in the left pleural cavity. The middle lower lobe of the right lung had a well-demarcated red-gray area, with small violaceous areas of increased consistency, having a dry, granular cross section surface. The adrenal glands showed bilateral medullary hemorrhage. No signs of autolysis were identified.\nGiven the persistence of the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, five lung fragments (0.5/0.3 cm) were collected by cutting with scalpel from the red-gray area, middle lower lobe (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania). RT-PCR testing was performed on these lung fragments and the result was positive. Total RNA isolation was performed with NucleoSpin RNA for tissue (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The E gene assay (Envelope gene) was used as the first line screening tool (Ct 23) then followed by confirmatory testing with an RdRp gene assay (Ct 25.3) (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene\u2014inside the Orf1ab polyprotein gene) and N gene assay (Ct 26.5) according to the Charite/Berlin protocol [].\nFor the histopathological examination, we used an Olympus BX40 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) with an Olympus Camedia 4040 photo camera, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain (staining kit produced by Laboratorium, Bucharest, Romania), Giemsa stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and Grocott stain (staining kit produced in our own laboratory). For immunohistochemistry, CD3 (Dako, polyclonal rabbit anti-human) and CD45 (Dako, monoclonal mouse antihuman, clone 2B11 + PD7/26) were used. The immunolabeling reaction was carried out by an automated immunostainer (Leica Bond-Max, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) using a polymer-based detection system (Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidin (DAB) as the chromogen.\nThe histopathological examination of the case evidenced preexisting lesions in various organs, which could be assigned to preexisting morbidities, favoring the severe evolution of COVID-19 infection. The histopathological examination also detected recent lesions occurring in the context of COVID-19 infection.\nIn the lung tissue, a background of lung fibrosis (A), with emphysematous areas (B) and thickened septa with myofibroblasts (C,D) was seen.\nOn this fibrosis background, the large and small arterial lung vessels show many thromboses (). The thromboses are accompanied by subpleural hemorrhagic foci (Tardieu spots, resulting from acute hypoxia), as well as by acute pulmonary edema foci in the rare alveoli unoccupied by inflammatory exudate. In the thrombosed vessels, lymphocytes adherent to the endothelium, with a significance of endotheliitis () but with low intensity, can be seen. In the dilated perivascular lymphatics, there is a cell-rich lymph fluid, with a cellularity similar to that of alveolar exudate (A).\nEosinophilic (A) and basophilic microthrombi (B) can also be observed, which represent aspects of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\nThe alveolar exudate is rich in foam cells ( and ). Alveolar exudate immunolabeling is positive for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45, a commonly used marker of hematopoietic cells except for erythrocytes and platelets) (A), but negative for CD3 (a common antibody for identifying T cells) (B). Immunolabeling of the innate immune system cells for induced nitric oxide (iNOS) is extremely weak ().\nIn the alveoli filled with macrophages, cystic forms with multinuclear content were also present (B). These proved to be positive by Giemsa stain (A,B), Grocott-Gomori\u2019s methenamine silver stain (C), and PAS stain (D).\nGiemsa stain also evidenced the fact that focally, some alveoli were invaded by a population of filamentous bacteria, in those areas the alveolar exudate having a bronchopneumonic, bacterial superinfection appearance ().\nIn the pleura, the whitish exudate described macroscopically was a mixture of fibrin and basophilic granular material, rich in round cells with vesicular nuclei. These cells were positive by Giemsa and Grocott staining, supporting the diagnosis of pneumocystosis (). Starting from these pleural images suggestive of Pneumocystis, it was inferred that the foamy alveolar material phagocyted by the activated macrophages was probably identical to this basophilic granular material, and the cystic forms described in were Pneumocystis cystic forms.\nThe myocardial muscle fibers are hypertrophied and fragmented, and in the medium intramyocardial venous vessels, rare microthrombi are present (A). In the liver, alcoholic steatosis is seen. In the medium and large branches of the suprahepatic veins, there is inflammatory infiltrate which allows the diagnosis of phlebitis (B).

The child developed fever on the evening of January 31, 2020. The child\u2019s body temperature was 38.4 \u00b0C, and had dry cough, runny nose and decreased appetite. The child had a normal birth and growth history, and received vaccinations according to plan. Furthermore, the child was breastfed and ate age-appropriate food. The child tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the nasopharyngeal swab in the evening of February 1, 2020, and was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of fever, dry cough and running nose. The patient\u2019s mother also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and was admitted at the same time.\nThe physical examination at admission revealed the following: body temperature 37.6 \u00b0C (ear temperature), respiratory rate 23/min, pulse rate 105 beats/min, blood pressure 95/56 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and SPO2 99%. The child was fully conscious, and had a good response. The skin and mucosa were intact, with no signs of rash or bleeding points. The anterior fontanel was closed. The conjunctivae were clear without exudates or hemorrhage. The sclera was non-icteric. There was mild throat congestion, but no enlargement of tonsils. The patient presented no signs of respiratory distress. The breath sounds were clear bilaterally in all lobes, without rhonchi or crackles. The heart rate and rhythm were normal. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs are auscultated. The abdomen was soft and flat, with no signs of pain upon palpation. No masses, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly were noted. The neurological examination was normal. The capillary refill was 2 seconds.\nLaboratory examinations were performed on February 2 after admission. The results revealed the following. Nasopharyngeal swabs revealed negative results (colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic method) for influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. In addition, the influenza A and B virus RNA (PCR method) was also found to be negative.

The chest computed tomography (CT) on February 5 revealed scattered ground glass opacities in the right lower lobe close to the pleura (Fig. a, c).\nThe possible route of transmission was investigated, and the following was revealed. The patient attended a family gathering event together with the patient\u2019s mother and grandmother on January 20. One person who also attended the gathering recently went to Wuhan, but was asymptomatic at that time. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 28. The child\u2019s grandmother started to present symptoms of fever and minor cough at 3 days after the gathering. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the nasopharyngeal swab (negative results in urine and stool) on January 29, and was admitted to the hospital for treatment. Her chest CT presented signs of viral pneumonia. The patient\u2019s mother presented with a symptom of nasal congestion without fever on January 31, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the nasopharyngeal swab on February 1. The virus RNA in stool, urine, vaginal discharge and breast milk were all negative despite the repeated testing. The chest CT indicated viral pneumonia. The patient\u2019s father tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on repeated tests.\nAfter admission, the patient was treated with 1.5 million units of recombinant human interferon \u03b1-2b by aerosolization, twice daily, during a course of 7 days, and also received other symptomatic treatment. On the second day of admission, the patient\u2019s body temperature returned to normal. The patient continued to have occasional dry cough, but the runny nose and appetite improved. The symptoms were completely relieved on February 8, with the disappearance of fever, cough and runny nose.\nThe test results for SARS-CoV-2 after admission: On February 5 (at 6 days after symptom onset), the virus RNA in urine was negative. On February 6, 7, 10, 14 and 25 (at 7, 8, 11, 15 and 26 days after symptom onset), the virus RNA in the nasopharyngeal swabs were positive. During the same period, virus RNA was also found to be positive in stool. On February 27 and 29 (at 28 and 30 days after symptom onset), the virus RNA tests were repeatedly negative in both the nasopharyngeal swabs and stool.

She had a 2-year history of hypertension controlled by medication, and no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. She had an intermittent cough with white sticky sputum, without any other symptoms or signs. On the same day, the patient was referred to the Fifth Central Hospital of Tianjin. Here vital signs were: body temperature 36.2 \u00b0C, pulse 86 beats/min, respiration rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 142/85 mmHg, and she was fully conscious. There was no visible enlargement of her superficial lymph nodes. She had no cyanosis, percussion pain in the sternum, or abnormal respiratory movements. She had coarse breath sounds in both lungs, no pleural friction sounds, and audible inspiratory crackles in the left lung. Heart sounds were strong and regular, with no pathological murmurs in any valve auscultation area. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was 8 ng/ml (normal range 0\u20135 ng/ml) and non-small cell lung cancer associated antigenCYF21\u20131 was 13.31 ng/ml (normal range 0.1\u20133.3 ng/ml). Other biochemical indicators were within the normal range.\nThe patient underwent a series of imaging examinations (Fig. ). Chest radiography on March 11, 2020 showed several nodules in the upper and lower segments of the left lung (Fig. a). Chest computed tomography (CT) on March 12, 2020 showed multiple solid nodules in the upper and lower left lung (Fig. b). The nodules had irregular outlines, with a maximum diameter of 65 mm, and some had a central cavity. A diagnosis of lymphoma was considered. Enhanced chest CT on March 16, 2020 (Fig. c\u2013e) showed multiple \u201ccauliflower like\u201d, soft tissue masses in the left lung, partially fused, with a maximum diameter of 71.3 mm and a CT value of ~ 36 HU. Enhanced CT showed enhancement with a maximum value of 60 Hu. The boundary between the mass and pleura was not clear, and the mass could not be separated from the pleura. There was irregular thickening of the pleura and no enlargement of lymph nodes. A malignant tumor could not be excluded.\nTo clarify the pathological diagnosis, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the left lung under local anesthesia on March 16, 2020. After consultation with our own and other hospitals(diagnostics were performed by Tianjin Fifth Central Hospital, Tianjin Cancer Hospital and Peking Union Medical College Hospital), the biopsy specimen was finally diagnosed as BA according to histomorphology and immunophenotype.\nWedge resection with safe margins may be the best treatment option for BA patients. However, if the lung is full of diffuse nodules, the whole lung may need to be removed, which seriously affects quality of life. Our patient was treated conservatively and followed up regularly. She was discharged on March 28, 2020.Her symptoms were managed through regular normal activities of daily living, strengthening respiratory protection, avoiding respiratory infection, and drug treatment to relieve dyspnea and cough.\nTo clarify the diagnosis, a double needle lung biopsy specimen was removed, 15 mm long, 1 mm in diameter. It was solid and gray white. Microscopically, there were irregular adenoid structures in a background of fibrosis and inflammation (Fig. a). The lesion had a two-layer cellular structure consisting of a basal and luminal layer, and had a lack of papillary structures. The micropapillae occasionally formed by non-ciliated cells germinated and burrowed into the alveolar cavity(Fig. b). The luminal layer was composed of type II alveolar cells and club cells. However, ciliated columnar cells and mucous cells in some flat areas could still be identified (Fig. c).The appearance was similar to adenocarcinoma in some areas, with alveolar destruction and stromal widening. Through careful observation, we found that the main reason for the stromal widening was edema and inflammatory infiltration. Unlike adenocarcinoma, there was a lack of thick collagen fibers (Fig. d). Tumor cells lacked atypia, mitosis and necrosis. A layer of material resembling the basement membrane surrounded the basal layer. The most important feature was a continuous layer of basal cells around the luminal layer.\nImmunohistochemical staining for p63, p40 and cytokeratin (CK)5/6 clearly showed the continuity of the basal cells (Fig. a, b). The luminal cells and some basal cells stained positive for thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1. The luminal cells expressed immunological markers of the terminal bronchioles (CKpan, CK7, Napsin A and CEA). A small number of mucous cells stained positive for periodic acid Schiff. The tumor showed a < 10% Ki-67 proliferation index (Fig. ).

Microbiological examination was not performed at that time. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875/125 mg twice daily for 5 days was prescribed empirically. The symptoms of tonsillitis resolved within five-day treatment, however, four days after completing the course of antibiotic therapy, sore throat, more prominent on the left side, reappeared. Two days later the patient presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of worsening sore throat, painful swallowing and fever. The patient was previously well, with no history of chronic diseases, recurrent tonsillitis or previous peritonsillar abscess. Seven months previously she gave birth to her second child and was still breastfeeding the baby. She denied smoking. On physical examination her temperature was 38\u00b0C, pulse rate: 80 beats/min, respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min and blood pressure: 120/80 mm Hg. Examination of the oral cavity and oropharynx showed enlarged and inflamed left tonsil as well as congested and bulging soft palate on the left side with contralateral displacement of the uvula. Both tonsils were covered with whitish exudate. No dental caries was noted. There was also bilateral, moderately tender submandibular lymphadenopathy. The remainder of physical examination was unremarkable. Blood tests results are shown in Table . Separate swabs were obtained from the surfaces of both tonsils. Next, under local anesthesia, diagnostic needle aspiration of left tonsil was performed by otolaryngologist, during which scanty amount of pus was obtained. This initial procedure was followed by incision and drainage. Tonsil swabs and abscess aspirate were sent to laboratory for microbiological examination. The patient refused hospitalization at the Otolaryngology Department, thus was discharged home on a 10-day course of cefuroxime (500 mg twice daily) and metronidazole (500 mg 3 times daily) with recommendation to discontinue breastfeeding for the duration of the antibiotic therapy and to present at follow-up visit to Otolaryngology Clinic after completing antibiotic therapy. The symptoms of peritonsillar abscess as well as fever were subsiding steadily during treatment, however on the last day of antibiotic therapy, swelling and pain of the left ankle appeared, thus the patient presented to her family doctor. Upon presentation she was afebrile and had marked oedema and pain of her left ankle. Her heart rate was 72 beats/min, she did not have an appreciable cardiac murmur. Her chest was clear to auscultation. Antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime (500 mg once daily) for next 5 days was prescribed, as well as pain relief medication with paracetamol. After completing antibiotic therapy the patient presented at follow-up visit to Otolaryngology Clinic. She was afebrile, with normal vital signs. Examination of oropharynx showed resolution of both, congestion and oedema of left tonsil and soft palate. There was no exudate on the tonsils. Cultures of throat swabs and abscess aspirate collected 2 weeks before revealed the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes in all three materials. According to the patient report, left ankle swelling with which she presented to her family doctor, resolved within 4 days. Upon presentation the patient only had moderate pain in the joint. She was consulted by rheumatologist. Her heart rate was 70 beats/min. She did not have a regurgitant murmur. Her chest was clear to auscultation. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer was evaluated and proved to be 412 IU/ml (normal 0\u2013200 IU/ml). The level of C-reactive protein was 13,0 mg/L. Control throat swabs were collected for culture, which revealed normal oropharynx flora. The patient was recommended to continue pain relief medication with paracetamol and present at follow-up visit to Rheumatology Clinic after 2 weeks. Her only complaint was persisting slight pain in left ankle joint. The results of physical examination were analogous to those observed at previous follow-up. ASO titer was 503 IU/ml. Control throat swabs were collected and culture yielded normal flora. The patient was recommended to present at follow-up visit at Rheumatology Clinic after 2 months. At that time, she was well. Ankle pain, according to the patient report, disappeared shortly after last visit. The results of physical examination were analogous to those observed previously. ASO titer was 396 IU/ml. Six months after the presentation at Emergency Department, the patient was well, with ASO titer reaching 262 IU/ml. Table summarizes the chronology of clinical findings and blood tests results.\nCultures of PTA aspirate revealed Streptococcus pyogenes as a predominant species as well as Prevotella oralis and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Tonsil swabs, collected at the time the patient presented with PTA, yielded copious growth of Streptococcus pyogenes as well as normal throat flora, namely Streptococcus viridians, Neisseria spp, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Two control throat swabs revealed only normal oropharynx flora. Bacterial species were identified with the use of routine microbiological methods, drug susceptibility of S. pyogenes was assessed using Vitek 2 Compact (bioM\u00e9rieux). Antimicrobial susceptibility results were interpreted according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing recommendations (EUCAST 2013, version 3.1) []. Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from tonsil swabs and abscess aspirate demonstrated identical susceptibility patterns. They were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and fully susceptible to all other antibiotics tested.

However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.\nLymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics\u2014diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration\u2014are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection.

Patient\u2019s social history was negative for smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use. Initial vital signs were Blood Pressure 109/68, Pulse 101, Repiratory Rate 16, Temperature 98.1, and O2 saturation of 100% on room air. On exam, the patient was noted to have edema and tenderness to palpation of his entire right neck, with erythema tracking from the superior border of his right clavicle to the angle of the jaw on the right. No induration, crepitus or bullae were noted on the skin. Oral examination was remarkable for edema and erythema of the right anterior tonsil, without exudates or fluctuance, with mild deviation of the uvula to left. The laboratory values were significant for elevated leukocyte count of 29,000 with 89.9 % neutrophils and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 37 and 2.32, respectively.

Given the clinical exam, CT findings highly suspicious for \u201ca gas-forming organism or necrotizing fasciitis,\u201d and his laboratory results, blood cultures were drawn and intravenous clindamycin, vancomycin and ceftriaxone were empirically started. Otolaryngology was emergently consulted and the decision was made to immediately take the patient to the operating room for incision, drainage and washout.\nFollowing nasotracheal intubation in the operating room (OR), the right neck was explored laterally into the retropharyngeal space. Purulent drainage was found to track via an overlying necrotic fascial plane into the parapharyngeal spaces as well as inferiorly into the superior mediastinum.

A residual phlegmon in the bilateral piriform sinuses was discovered, and the patient was then taken back to the OR for repeat right neck exploration, direct laryngoscopy, and bilateral incision and drainage of the peritonsillar space. Intra-operatively, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted to perform an open lateral thoracotomy to drain a posterior mediastinal phlegmon.\nDespite repeat drainage, the patient began to decompensate, requiring multiple vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion, and he suffered from persistent fevers, acute renal failure and transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase 4202, alanine aminotransferase 1922).

She was admitted to the hospital due to fatigue, shortness of breath while playing with friends one month ago. Physical examination on admission revealed a systolic murmur in the left para-sternum, trans-thoracic echocardiography showed a peri-membranous VSD extended into inlet septum with a diameter of 12 mm, left to right shunting, pressure gradient via the defect was 20 mmHg, a PDA of 4 mm in diameter. The patient had undergone trans-catheter PDA closure first, and 3 weeks later, TES was performed for VSD repair without robotic assistance.\nPatient was placed in supine position; two arms were along the body, under general anesthesia with single-lumen endotracheal tube. We used a no.6 Knitted Dacron graft (Vascutek Terumo, Bangkok, Thailand) which was connected to the right common FA of the patient with an end-to-side anastomosis. The other side of the graft was connected to the arterial line of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. Superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) cannulae were inserted via internal jugular vein (IJV) and femoral vein, respectively, using Seldinger technique. When CPB was started, the arterial pressure gradually increased to 260 mmHg, we switched to bilateral FA cannulation with an additional 10Fr FA cannula (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn, USA) (the predicted size was 16Fr) was directly inserted to the left common FA. After having additional femoral cannula, the arterial pressure declined and stabilized at 180\u2013200 mmHg.\nFour soft trocars (Covidien, Hampshire, Mansfield, USA) were placed in the right chest of the patient, included: one 12 mm trocar in the 5th intercostal space (ICS) at the anterior axillary line as the main working port, one 5 mm trocar in the 4th ICS at the mid-axillary line as the second working port, one 5 mm trocar in the 5th ICS at mid-axillary line as the camera port and one 5 mm trocar in the 6th ICS at the mid-axillary line for left atrium sucker. After snaring SVC, we pushed a 16 G Surflo\u00ae I.V. Catheters (Terumo Corporation, Laguna, Philippines) into the ascending aorta through the anterior right chest wall and used it as an aortic root needle. Myocardial protection was achieved by antegrade Custodiol\u00ae HTK solution (Koehler Chemi, Alsbach-Haenlien, Germany) through aortic root after clamping aorta by Chitwood clamp (Scanlan International, Inc, St Paul, MN, USA).\nRight atrium (RA) was opened in parallel to atrioventricular groove, atrial septal was intact, and we punctured atrial septum at the location of ovale foramen to place the drainage of left atrium. The defect was exposed by taking some stitches to hang RA wall to the pericardium. The lesion extended into the inlet septum, some chordae tendineae of septal and anterior leaflets of tricuspid valve crossed the defect. We split the commissure of anterior and septal leaflets to clearly expose the defect. The VSD was closed using artificial patch, continuous combined with interrupted suture (). The RA was closed using two layer of continuous suture after the split in the leaflets and the ovale foramen had been closed. After declamping the aorta, the heart re-beat in sinus rhythm, de-airing via aortic root needle. Extracorporeal circulation was then stopped and the operation was finished with no difficulties. CPB time and aorta cross-clamp (ACC) time were 185 and 150 min, respectively. Echocardiography prior to discharge showed completely closed VSD, no tricuspid regurgitation.

Because of the persisting fever, the child was transferred to three other hospitals, recently to a tertiary care hospital, where he was evaluated for immunodeficiency. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was carried out under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation because of declining general condition. Since respiratory functions had deteriorated dramatically, the child was transferred to our institution for ECMO-support (at 4 wk after first presentation). No definite diagnosis existed to that time.\nMedical history taking with the parents revealed an uneventful pregnancy and birth in Germany. The parents originated from the Balkan peninsula. The patient was the first child and the parents claimed to be healthy.\nThe child was unconscious due to deep analgo-sedation (Glasgow coma score of 3/15). The vesical temperature was 40.3\u00b0C, heart rate was 142 bpm, blood pressure was 82/44 mmHg (under continuous infusion with epinephrine 2.0 mcg/kg/min), weight was 7.9 kg (15th percentile, World Health Organization scale), length was 70 cm (30th percentile, World Health Organization scale), SpO2 was 70%. The pressure-controlled ventilation maintained peak inspiratory pressure of 60 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 12 cm H2O, FiO2 of 1.0, frequency of 40 pm, and Horovitz quotient of 30. The spleen was 5 cm and the liver 6 cm, palpable in midclavicular lines. Our first clinical impression was that of a systemic infection with severe acute respiratory failure and unexplained lymphoproliferation.\nBlood analysis revealed pancytopenia (hemoglobin: 4.3 mmol/L; leucocytes: 2.600 \u00d7 109/L; neutrophils: 800 \u00d7 109/L; platelets: 32.000 \u00d7 109/L), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (194 mg/L; normal range: <5 mg/L), ferritin (1,020 \u03bcg/L; normal range: 14\u2013103 \u03bcg/L), triglycerides (3.58 mmol/L normal range: 0.4\u20131.6mmol/L), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (30,247 U/mL; normal range: 158\u2013623 U/mL). Analyses of arterial blood gases showed pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 93 mmHg, pO2 of 30 mmHg, and base-excess of \u221211.1 mmol/L.\nInitial imaging with x-ray showed a \u201cwhite lung\u201d () and with ultrasound showed hepato- and splenomegaly. Further imaging work-up, with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, could not be performed because of the instable situation.\nBone marrow biopsy showed a distinct hemophagocytosis upon cytologic evaluation (). The lymphocyte population consisted of CD3+ of 1,358 \u00d7 109/L, CD4+ of 1,119 \u00d7 109/L, CD8+ of 2,017 \u00d7 109/L, CD19+ of 487 \u00d7 109/L, and CD56+ of 2 \u00d7 109/L. Further immunological studies by fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed normal fresh degranulation of natural killer cells (14.7%; normal: >10%), and normal expressions of perforin, CD27, SAP, and XIAP on d 7. Microscopy of the patient's hairs showed no anomaly of pigmentation, as would be found in children with Griscelli syndrome.\nThe patient was further evaluated with cultures of blood, urine, tracheal secretion, and stool. Examinations for ova or parasites provided negative results. All serological and PCR tests for viruses (Epstein\u2013Barr, human immunodeficiency, cytomegaly, hanta, adeno, influenza a/b, respiratory syncytial, herpes simplex, corona, metapneumonia, parvo B19, parainfluenza, rhino, and enterovirus) were negative. Also negative were results of testing for leishmania, legionella, aspergillus, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Hemophilus influenza b, and pneumococcus-PCR/immunoglobulins (IgG/IgM).\nAll tumors markers \u03b1-fetoprotein (2.5 IU/mL), neuron-specific enolase (10 ng/mL), \u00df-hCG (0.2 mIU/mL), homovanillic acid (10 mg/g creatinine), and vanillylmandelic acid (18 mg/g creatinine) were unrevealing.\nA positive result from the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) was the first indication for possible TBC infection on d 12. However, microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain) as well as PCR testing for TBC in the first bronchoalveolar lavage were both negative on d 6. Further along in the clinical course, PCR for TBC became positive and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture returned positive results on d 40. The identified strain of M. tuberculosis was found to be sensitive to rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid, retrospectively.\nAfter discontinuation of the ECMO therapy, further imaging was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system showed a miliary TBC and a computed tomography scan of the thorax revealed a calcified, round lesion consistent with TBC ().\nNormal functional assays virtually excluded hereditary forms of HLH. A secondary form was therefore recommended to be considered, as was a complete diagnostic re-evaluation (infection, tumor, leukemia). The etoposide (VP-16, according to the HLH-04 protocol) was terminated after three doses administered according the HLH protocol.\nThe child presented with severe hypoxia, and respiratory and metabolic acidosis, despite pressure-controlled ventilation and attempts of high frequency oscillation ventilation, both at high inspiratory oxygen level. The decision was therefore made to start veno-venous ECMO immediately after admission of the patient (see ). A 16F Avalon double-lumen cannula (Getinge AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) was inserted in the right internal jugular vein. A blood flow of 120 mL/kg/min was established, which was sufficient to achieve a PaO2 between 85 and 95 mmHg, and a PaCO2 between 40 and 50 mmHg. Ventilator parameters were reduced as much as possible (peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm H2O, and FiO2 of 0.4) to guarantee \u201clung protection\u201d as well as a transcutaneous O2-saturation of >90%. After initiation of the ECMO catecholamine support with epinephrine and noradrenaline (maximum dosage of 0.18 \u03bcg/kg/min) was progressively weaned (until d 12).\nBecause of the fulfillment of criteria for HLH therapy, the HLH-94 protocol was initiated. The boy was treated with dexamethasone at 10 mg/m2 (d 2 to d 12, and reduced/discontinued at d 24) and etoposide at 150 mg/m2 (three doses in total, given on d 2 through d 7 and being stopped upon normal results from the T cell degranulation assay on d 7). Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulin (0.5 g/kg body weight, given on d 2 through d 15) was administered.\nWith the suspicion of TBC, on d 12 (positive IRGA) a 4-fold tuberculostatic therapy was started, consisting of rifampicin at 1 \u00d7 15 mg/kg body weight/d, ethambutol at 1 \u00d7 30 mg/kg body weight/d, pyrazinamide at 1 \u00d7 30 mg/kg body weight/d, and isoniazid 1 \u00d7 10 mg/kg body weight/d). At 10 d after the start of tuberculostatic therapy, there was improvement in the general condition (stable cardiorespiratory situation, rising tidal volumes). The C-reactive protein level declined from 194 mg/L to 5 mg/L on d 28, followed by the soluble interleukin-2 receptor from 30,247 U/mL to 931 U/mL on d 40. After full lung recovery, the ECMO support was able to be discontinued on d 28. The child was extubated on d 33.\nThe boy survived this critical condition. After discharge on d 66, the child was re-evaluated on d 98, d 460, and d 745. During that time, the boy developed frontotemporal hygroma (left side > right side) with spontaneous resolution. Neurological assessment during the follow-up period revealed a mild retardation of development (speech and fine motor skills) and moderate aggressive behavior with beginning improvement.", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Answer": "32.92", "LLM Explanation": "The patient's weight is 7.9 kg.

She had experienced episodes of such symptoms during the previous 2 years. Hypoglycemia with a glucose level of 2.0 mmol/l had been detected during one of the episodes. For the next several months, the patient did not take any diagnostic tests. In 2017, the frequency of the hypoglycemic episodes increased. A fasting test was performed 2 years after the first episode in June 2018. The results showed hypoglycemia 0.91 mmol/l (normal range 3.0\u20135.5 mmol/l), insulin 54.4 mkE/ml (normal range 3\u201326 mkE/ml) and c-peptide 5,51 ng/ml (normal range 0.79\u20134,19 ng/ml). The patient was admitted to our hospital in normal condition. Her BMI was 39 kg/m2; total weight gain was 20 kg since the disease onset.\nA transabdominal and endoscopic ultrasound also did not reveal any pathological findings in the pancreas. Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI scans of the abdominal cavity were then performed. A tumor of the pancreas was not revealed, although a pathologic mass in the sixth segment of the liver was detected ().\nDue to being unable to identify a tumor of the pancreas and the pathological finding in the liver, we made a decision to perform arterial calcium stimulation with hepatic venous sampling (ASVS). The analysis showed increased insulin and c-peptide levels in almost all stimulated arteries. Moreover, the highest and most prolonged peaks of insulin and c-peptide levels were detected at the points of the common hepatic artery and the right hepatic artery (). This became the most important finding for further treatment.\nTherefore, all performed diagnostic procedures (transabdominal US, endoscopic US, CT, MRI and ASVS) could not reveal a pancreatic tumor. However, the lesion of the liver looked like a neuroendocrine neoplasm.\nExplorative laparotomy was then performed. Intraoperatively, the pancreatic texture was soft and surrounded by peripancreatic fat tissue without any signs of atrophy or sclerosis. Visualization and palpation of the pancreas did not reveal any tumor. But a soft encapsulated tumor 4 cm in size was found in the sixth segment of the liver. An intra-operative ultrasound was performed. There were no tumors either of the pancreas or of the liver other than the neoplasm described above. Hence, a decision to remove the tumor of the liver was made. This was performed using a bipolar and harmonic ace with minimal organ trauma. The frozen section confirmed a neuroendocrine tumor. The glucose level became 9\u201310 mmol/l right after the procedure, and no glucose infusions were required.\nHistological and immunohystochemical analysis showed a well-differentiated insulin-producing neuroendocrine tumor of grade 2. Ki67 was 4% with positive reaction with Synaptophysin (MRQ-40, Cell Marque): ++; Chromogranin A (DAK-A3, DAKO): ++; CD56 (123C3.D5, Cell Marque): ++ and Insulin (polyclonal, DAKO): +++ ().\nPost-operative recovery was uneventful. There were no episodes of hypoglycemia. The range of glucose blood levels was 6\u20138 mmol/l. The patient was discharged for outpatient checkup on the 14th day after the surgery. During the 2 weeks after the operation, the body weight decreased by 8.5 kg (8.7% of body mass).\nLong-term results were assessed on the 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after the surgery.

Trachea was already intubated with a size 3.5-mm internal diameter uncuffed tracheal tube with oxygen supplementation via T piece. Respiratory rate was 60/min with nasal flaring and substernal and intercostal retractions. On auscultation, there were no adventitious sounds in the chest.\nPatient was nebulized with salbutamol and shifted inside the operating room.

She was a nurse in a medical ward and had no prior history of TB. She was separated from her husband and intended to use donated sperm for her assisted conception treatment. The timeline of interventions is summarized in Table below.\nThe initial evaluation for subfertility (in a different institution) included a diagnostic laparoscopy performed 8 years prior. The laparoscopy had revealed dense pelvic adhesions (\u201ca frozen pelvis\u201d), and an impression of tubal factor subfertility was made. It appears that there was no deliberate attempt to make a definitive diagnosis as to the cause of the tubal disease as no tissue samples or swabs were assessed. She had undergone a pelvic ultrasound scan which was reported as normal and had had a negative pap smear. There were neither further details of this prior evaluation nor a detailed summary from her previous gynecologist.\nShe neither had a history of pelvic pain nor a history suggestive of previous sexually transmitted infections. She did not report any symptoms suggestive of TB, notably fever, night sweats, or weight loss. She weighed 84 kg, was 1.58 meters tall with a body mass index (BMI) of 33. Her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg and her clinical examination was essentially normal. She had no lymphadenopathy, acne, or hirsutism. Her gonadal hormone profile presented in Table was in keeping with PCOS.\nThe initial high estradiol (E2) levels and the biochemical evidence of PCOS prompted the use of an exogenous progestogen to initiate endometrial shedding prior to baseline ultrasound scan in preparation for an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle. She received medroxyprogesterone (Provera) 10 mg orally once a day for 5 days but had no withdrawal bleed. Two weeks after administration of medroxyprogesterone, she still reported no withdrawal bleed. A subsequent pelvic ultrasound scan showed normal uterine morphology. Her endometrial thickness was 3 mm with a small amount of endometrial fluid with no focal endometrial pathology demonstrable on ultrasound. Her ovaries had a polycystic appearance with multiple small peripheral follicles. A simple cyst of 4 cm in size was visualized in her right ovary. The ultrasound findings further supported the diagnosis of PCOS.\nEndometrial assessment by hysteroscopy was undertaken in view of the presence of endometrial fluid and the negative progesterone challenge test. Hysteroscopy revealed an atrophic endometrium interspersed with areas of thickened endometrium, with no synechiae, and bilaterally obliterated and poorly visualized tubal ostia. Directed endometrial biopsies were taken. Histology showed endometrial tissue with a normal gland to stromal ratio. Numerous granulomas, with epithelioid histiocytes, plasma cells and Langhans giant cells were visualized in the stroma with some areas of necrosis. A Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain was negative. A conclusion of granulomatous endometritis possibly TB endometritis was made.\nFollowing the diagnosis of TB, further investigations were carried out. A chest X-ray was normal and an HIV test was negative. Her liver function tests, creatinine, and full blood count were all normal. She was referred to a physician for TB treatment and plans for assisted reproductive technology (ART) were deferred. Treatment for TB endometritis was started by use of a 6-month regimen of antitubercular therapy. An initial 2-month intensive phase of four drugs (rifampicin 600 mg once daily, isoniazid 300 mg once daily, pyrazinamide 2000 mg once daily, and ethambutol 1600 mg once daily) was followed by a 4-month course of two drugs (rifampicin 600 mg once daily, isoniazid 300 mg once daily). In addition, a daily dose of pyridoxine 25 mg was administered throughout the 6 months. Antihypertensive treatment was initiated in the second month of antitubercular treatment. She was evaluated after a week of initiation of TB therapy and thereafter every month by the physician. She was compliant on all her medications and experienced no adverse effects. She reported no menses despite completing the TB treatment. The supervising TB physician did not consider it clinically relevant to re-biopsy after a full course of TB therapy.\nShe maintained her desire for conception and revisited the fertility clinic. A follow-up ultrasound scan showed less evident endometrial fluid compared to the initial pelvic ultrasound scan with an endometrial thickness of 3.7 mm. Her ovaries were still polycystic but the 4 cm right ovarian cyst was no longer present. A decision on a second trial of endometrial stimulation/shedding was made. She received one cycle of low-dose combined oral contraceptive pills but reported no menses. There was no change in endometrial findings on follow-up scan.\nA conclusion of endometrial scarring post-endometrial TB was made. Further attempts at endometrial stimulation were discouraged in view of her very high endogenous E2 and complete failure of response to exogenous steroids. The options of surrogacy or adoption were discussed while further ART interventions were discouraged due to the endometrial damage.", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Answer": "124", "LLM Explanation": "The patient's weight is 84 kg.

The cat had been fed on a commercial kitten food. The cat was examined by the referring veterinarian because of its seizures and reluctance to move for 2 weeks before its initial presentation. The cat\u2019s serum biochemistry profile revealed hypocalcemia (total calcium 1.27 mmol/L; reference range 1.97\u20132.82 mmol/L) and high alkaline phosphatase (835 U/L; reference range 14\u2013192 U/l), aspartate transaminase (70 U/L; reference range 0\u201332 U/L), total bilirubin (3.4 mg/dL; reference range 0\u20130.9 mg/dL), and creatine kinase (3470 U/L; reference range 0\u2013394 U/L). Urea and creatinine were within the reference range (Table ). The complete blood count revealed no abnormalities, and the tests results for feline leukemia virus antigen and antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus were negative. Based on these results, the referring veterinarian suspected that the cause of the seizures was related to hypocalcemia. Therefore, the cat was treated with levetiracetam (20 mg/kg, IV, BID) and calcium gluconate 8.5% (0.5 ml/kg, PO, BID) for 2 weeks, but its clinical condition did not improve.\nOn initial examination, the cat was lethargic and reluctant to move. Her appetite was good, but defecation appeared to be painful. Her family history, including whether the parents and littermates were alive, was unknown. Serum biochemistry revealed that both the total and ionized calcium levels were low (total calcium 1.55 mmol/L; reference range 2.05\u20133.02 mmol/L, ionized calcium 0.74 mmol/L; reference range 1.20\u20131.35 mmol/L). Radiographs showed skeletal demineralization and the presence of abnormally wide growth plates on the long bones (Fig. ). The differential diagnosis for hypocalcemia with skeletal abnormalities includes primary hypoparathyroidism, nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal secondary hyperparathyroidism, intestinal malabsorption, and VDDR. However, the cat had previously eaten a well-balanced commercial kitten food (Science Diet kitten, Hill\u2019s Colgate Japan) before becoming obviously ill, so nutritional deficiency seemed highly unlikely. The levels of parathyroid hormone (Immulyze intact PTH III, Simens) and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D RIA Kit FR, Immunodiagnostic Systems) were determined as elements of the differential diagnosis of hypocalcemia. The parathyroid hormone level was high (99.7 pg/ml; reference range 8.0\u201325.0 pg/ml), but 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (23.1 pg/ml) was low compared with the levels of healthy cats (Table ). The urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.032 and traces of protein. No bacterial growth was detected in the urine culture. Consequently, VDDR was suspected to be the cause of hypocalcemia and skeletal abnormalities in this cat.\nOn the day after the initial examination, the cat experienced seizures suspected of being hypocalcemic in origin. Slow administration of calcium gluconate 8.5% IV (1 ml/kg) was commenced, and the cat was continuously monitored by ECG, but no arrhythmia was detected. Several calcium gluconate 8.5% (1 ml/kg, IV) treatment stopped the seizures, but neither her total calcium nor her ionized calcium level increased sufficiently. Therefore, the cat was administered 8.5% calcium gluconate (starting dose, 1.0 ml/kg/h) in 0.9% saline solution by continuous rate infusion (CRI) (Table ).\nStarting on day 2, the cat received alfacalcidol (Onealfa Tablets) by CRI of 8.5% calcium gluconate. However, she did not respond well to treatment with the standard dose (0.01\u20130.03 \u03bcg/kg, PO, SID) of alfacalcidol so the CRI of 8.5% calcium gluconate was stopped. The final dose of alfacalcidol was very large, and 1 \u03bcg/kg, PO, TID was required to maintain the cat\u2019s general condition in the absence of CRI of 8.5% calcium gluconate (Table ). On day 16, the cat was discharged from hospital. Radiographs were taken again 2.5 months after the initial treatment was started. The cat\u2019s bone structure was still abnormal, but showed marked improvement (Fig. ).\nThe hypocalcemia, low 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, radiographic changes, and poor response to alphacalcidol led us to suspect a genetic abnormality of vitamin D metabolism in this cat. In humans and cats, type 2 VDDR is characterized by high 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels. In the cat examined in the present study, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol was lower than in healthy cats, and a huge dose of alfacalcidol was required to maintain her serum calcium concentration. Hence, we decided to analyze the gene sequences of CYP2R1 (ENSEMBL Gene ID ENSFCAG00000011383) and CYP27B1 (ENSEMBL Gene ID ENSFCAG00000014701) in healthy control cats (2 intact males and a spayed female, all domestic short-haired cats owned by our veterinary teaching hospital staff) and the affected this cat. The feline CYP2R gene contains five exons encoding an enzyme of 501 amino acids, and the CYP27B1 gene contains nine exons encoding an enzyme of 508 amino acids. We designed primer pairs for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the individual exons and the immediate flanking regions of CYP2R1 and CYP27B1. Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). PCR amplification of the fragments was performed with 20 ng of genomic DNA in GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega), which also contained the primer pair (10 \u03bcM each) and water, with 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 55 \u00b0C, and 1 min at 72 \u00b0C (Table ). The PCR product sizes were verified as correct by agarose gel electrophoresis separation, the products were prepared for sequencing using the FastGene Gel/PCR Extraction Kit (Nippon Genetics), and then sequenced by a commercial DNA sequencing service (Fasmac). The sequences from the healthy cats and the affected cat were compared, and although no abnormalities in the CYP27B1 gene were present in the affected cat, we did identify the CYP2R1 variant in exon 5; c.1380G > G/A and c.1386del in this cat (Fig. ). The variant, where T is deleted at position c.1386, causes a frameshift mutation in the gene, resulting in chain termination at the position encoding amino acid 481 in the full-length 501 amino acid protein (p.Phe462Leufs*20). The partial sequence of CYP2R1 exon 5 in this cat has been available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession number LC424161. We next searched for the structural information for proteins affected by this nonsynonymous mutation using the protein database HOMOCOS (). The amino acid sequences between human and feline CYP2R1 were almost identical (96.7% identity) and all contact sites with vitamin D3 were conserved (Additional file ). Therefore, we referred an already-known crystal structure of human CYP2R1-vitamin D3 complex (pdb ID 3c6g) []. Two contact sites (amino acids 487 and 488) in the CYP2R1-vitamin D3 complex were missing in the sequence from the affected cat (Additional file ), suggesting that the T deletion in exon 5 of CYP2R1 linked with a remarkable loss of CYP2R1 protein function in this cat.\nAfter the CYP2R1 variant was identified, the affected cat was treated with a standard dose of calcitriol (Caldemin; 2.5\u20133.5 ng/kg, PO, SID), which restored the total and ionized calcium levels to within the reference range. The level of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol at \u2212 80 \u00b0C stored serum sample of initial presentation was additionally measured using a commercial ELISA kit (HVD3 ELISA Kit, MyBioSource). The low level of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (12 nmol/L) compared with the levels of healthy cats (Table ) is likely to type 1B VDDR in humans [\u2013].", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Answer": "2.75", "LLM Explanation": "The patient's weight is 1.1 kg.

The patient had been suffering dyspnea on exertion for three years. His vital signs were blood pressure (BP) 130\u2013150/70\u201380 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 80\u2013100 beats/min, respiratory rate (RR) 18\u201322 rates/min, and body temperature 36.2\u2103. The patient's oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) while receiving air was 75\u201389%, which was partially corrected to 91\u201398% while receiving 2 L/min of oxygen via nasal prong (VNP). Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) under oxygen administration revealed the following: pH 7.39, arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) 44.6 mmHg, arterial O2 partial pressure(PaO2) 65.3 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2013) 26.1 mEq/L.\nDuring induction, both mask ventilation and intubation were difficult (laryngeal view: Cormack-Lehane grade IV). Intubation trials with a 37-Fr. left-sided double lumen tube (DLT) (Mallinckrodt\u2122, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) and laryngoscopy, followed by a videostylet (Optiscope\u00ae, Pacific Medical, Seoul, Korea) failed. Hence, a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was used to intubate a single lumen tube (SLT) (ID 8.0), and then the SLT was changed to a DLT using a tube exchanger.\nLeft one-lung ventilation (OLV) was maintained with an SpO2 of 86\u201390% at an inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2) of 1.0 during right-lung lavage. We performed external percussion physiotherapy with an automatic mechanical percussion device (The Vest\u2122 Model 205 [Airway Clearance System], frequency 10 Hz, duration 3 minutes, Hill-Rom, Charleston, SC, USA) rather than manual chest percussion. After right-lung lavage, we resumed two-lung ventilation (TLV) with intermittent suction for 20 minutes (FIO2 1.0). For left-lung lavage, right OLV was started with an FIO2 of 1.0, but it was impossible to maintain SpO2 > 80% (). Therefore, we decided to postpone left-lung lavage until conditions in the right lung improved (). A chest X-ray taken after intensive care unit (ICU) transfer showed no specific findings, including pneumothorax. One day after the lavage, while in the ICU, the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation, extubated, and transferred to the general ward.\nThree days later, the patient was returned to the operating room for left-lung lavage. The patient's SpO2 was 91\u201396% with O2 3 L/min VNP. We intubated the trachea with a SLT via Glide-Scope (Verathon Medical, British Columbia, Canada) and then changed the SLT to a DLT with a tube exchanger because the previous intubation was difficult. We confirmed breath sounds from both lungs, and right and left lung ventilation during separation through auscultation. The proper tube location was confirmed using an FOB.\nTLV was performed in volume-controlled mode: FIO2 1.0, tidal volume of 400 ml, RR of 15 rates/min, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 31 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. PaO2 was 57 mmHg (SpO2 86%) on ABGA examination. Fifty minutes after induction, we started right OLV in pressure-controlled mode: FIO2 1.0, inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O above PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 200 ml, and RR of 20 /min. Within a few minutes of starting right OLV, the patient's SpO2 plunged below 80%, so we rapidly resumed TLV and re-confirmed the proper position of the DLT using an FOB. We did not observe any bronchial secretion or obstruction. Right OLV was tried again, but the patient's SpO2 rapidly decreased to < 80% within a few minutes. After resuming TLV, 2.5 mg of salbutamol was nebulized to relieve any bronchial constriction, and 100 mg of hydrocortisone was injected intravenously to improve symptoms. During manual ventilation, we detected very poor lung compliance. In auscultation, the patient's breath sounds from the right lung were very distant and nearly inaudible. Therefore, we suspected he had a right-side pneumothorax, which was confirmed on chest X-ray (). A chest tube was inserted by a thoracic surgeon, and a follow-up chest X-ray showed that the pneumothorax had decreased (). Two hours after induction, lung compliance and arterial oxygenation improved: FIO2 1.0, tidal volume of 450 ml, RR of 18/min, PIP of 24 cmH2O, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. PaO2 improved to 93 mmHg on the following ABGA examination ().\nWe re-tried right OLV and were finally able to maintain SpO2 > 90%: FIO2 1.0, inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O above PEEP 5 cmH2O, tidal volume of 320 ml, and RR of 20 /min, without any severe air leakage or tidal-volume loss. The left-lung lavage was started along with right OLV with the chest tube inserted state. During the remaining lavage period, we maintained SpO2 > 85% without further deterioration.\nAfter lavage, the patient was transferred to the ICU and received mechanical ventilation. On postoperative day (POD) 1, the patient developed a high fever (38.8\u2103) and was diagnosed as having pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion in the right lower lobe, so antibiotics were administered. The chest tube was removed on POD 3, and extubation was performed on POD 4. The patient was transferred to the general ward on POD 7 and discharged on POD 19.

The physical examination and laboratory finding including a chest x-ray taken for preoperative evaluations were normal and pulmonary function was normal.\nNo premedication was given. Initial blood pressure was 170/85 mmHg, heart rate 67 beats/min, oxygen saturation 97%, and body temperature 36.0\u2103. Thiopental 250 mg, lidocaine 40 mg, and rocuronium 40 mg were administered intravenously. Endotracheal intubation was done successfully without complication. After intubation, the lung sound on both lung fields was remarkable and tube was fixed at 21 cm. For maintenance of anesthesia, oxygen 2 L/min, N2O 2 L/min, sevoflurane (1.2-2.0 vol%) were administered, and remifentanil was continuously infused 0.1-0.2 \u00b5g/kg/min.

Risk factors were arterial hypertension and cigarette smoking. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) with hyponatremia was noticed and tumour search detected metastatic liver disease and enlarged hilar lymph nodes. Blood analysis revealed elevated levels for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin-fragment (Cyfra), and liver biopsy specified metastases of a small cellular, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumour (NET). Further staging via FDG PET disclosed the primary tumour near the left lung hilus with positive mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, diffuse osseous filiarisation, and a sole metastasis in the right adrenal gland. Oncology board consensus decision was made for palliative chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposid (80 mg/sqm, 120 mg/sqm, resp.) as common for dedifferentiated NET.\nTwo weeks after the initial bout of chemotherapy the patient presented in the Surgical Department with incomplete ischemia of the left lower limb. Immediate interventional recanalization failed and open embolectomy of the tibiofibular trunk with consecutive venous patch plasty was performed. Histological examination of the embolus showed no malignancy. Three days later reischemia of the same leg occurred and the operative procedure was repeated. Search for embolic origin by CT-scan disclosed clinically inapparent pulmonary embolism in three lobes. Mural thrombus of the infrarenal aorta with perifocal aortic wall calcifications appeared identical to the initial staging CT (). All tumour manifestations showed downsizing in response to the previous systemic chemotherapy. High doses of unfractioned heparins (up to 40.000 IE/d) were administered for anticoagulation. Aspirin was given for platelet inhibition. Activated partial thromboplastin time presented sufficiently prolonged with normal levels of antithrombin III when symptoms began.\nAgain four days later, transfemoral and pedal embolectomy with multilocular patch plasties of all native crural arteries as ultima ratio due to complete ischemia had to be performed.

The first episode was a sudden onset of complete paralysis below distal thigh, and he had no other symptoms except leg paralysis. At a local clinic, physical examination revealed symmetric hyporeflexia in both lower extremities. Laboratory analysis revealed mild hypokalemia as below: Na+, 146 mmol/L; K+, 2.7 mmol/L; Cl-, 110 mmol/L; tCO2, 25 mmol/L without abnormality of blood gas analysis. Electrocardiogram showed only sinus tachycardia without atrioventricular block or prominent U wave. However, further evaluation for hypokalemia was not taken, even though there was a suggestion of hypokalemic paralysis, and the patient was just advised to eat an adequate dietary supplement of potassium rich food without any medication by the local clinic. After two weeks, a second episode of leg weakness occurred after morning meal. The muscle weakness was initially subtle but progressed in paralysis below knee and lasted for 6 hours. Thus, he was referred to our hospital. However, the patient visited our clinic the next day, when the paralysis had already subsided.\nThere was no past history or family history of neuromuscular disease and endocrinologic disease, except for his aunt's hypothyroidism. His appearance was reasonably healthy. His height was 168 cm, his weight was 60 kg, and his body mass index was 21.2 kg/m2. His blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, his respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and his body temperature was 36.8\u2103. He had mild tachycardia with a heart rate of 100-110 beats/min,, but he had no palpitations. Neurological examination findings, including deep tendon reflex and cerebellar function test, were normal. The laboratory findings showed normal complete blood cell counts, normal electrolytes as below: Na+, 140 mmol/L; K+, 4.4 mmol/L; Cl-, 104 mmol/L; tCO2, 24 mmol/L. The laboratory findings also showed his normal liver, kidney and cardiac functions. His urine K+ excretion rate was normally low as 0.96 of urine K+/Cr ratio (range, 0-2). There were no abnormal laboratory findings to suggest adrenal hormone excess or primary hyperaldosteronism: adrenocorticotropic hormone, 40.11 pg/mL (range, 3.5-13.2 pg/mL); cortisol, 8.7 \u00b5g/dL (range, 5.0-23.0 \u00b5g/dL); 17 hydroxyprogesterone, 2.68 ng/mL (range, 0.6-3.42 ng/mL); aldosterone, 180.29 pg/mL (range, 38.9-306.8 pg/mL); renin, 6.13 ng/mL/hr (range, 1.31-3.95 ng/mL/hr); epinephrine, 0.030 ng/mL (range, 0-0.30 ng/mL); norepinephrine, 0.087 ng/mL (range, 0-0.80 ng/mL). Thyroid function test (TFT) revealed a hyperthyroidism: serum free thyroxine (fT4), 2.10 ng/dL (range, 0.70-1.48 ng/dL); triiodothyronine (T3), 2.95 ng/mL (range, 0.58-1.59 ng/mL); thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), <0.025 mU/L (range, 0.35-4.94 mU/L). Thus, he was diagnosed as having hypokalemic paralysis due to hyperthyroidim. Serum TSH receptor antibodies were high at 6.05 IU/L (range, 0-1.75 IU/L), thyroid stimulating antibody was positive, and thyroid ultrasonography revealed diffuse enlarged thyroid and increased vascularity. These findings were consistent with Graves' disease as etiology of his hyperthyroidism. He was initially treated with lower dose of an antithyroid drug (methimazole 5 mg once daily) than usual, since his thyrotoxic symptoms and signs were absent, and his level of serum fT4 was not prominent. In addition, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) was simultaneously used for preventing the paralysis. After two weeks, a follow-up TFT revealed aggravated hyperthyroidism, and he was treated with increased dose of antithyroid drugs. After two months, since his heart rate and blood pressure were stable and he had no symptoms of palpitations, \u03b2-blockers were discontinued successfully.

The patient had no other remarkable medical or familial history. There was no occupational history indicating exposure to organic solvents (e.g., benzene).\nThe patient started binge eating and purging at 14 years of age. At 16 years of age, she was diagnosed with AN, and had multiple hospitalizations in this regard. The patient\u2019s first admission to our department was at 26 years of age, at which time her body mass index (BMI) was 9.5 kg/m2 (weight, 22 kg; height, 152 cm). The patient had mild, transient bicytopenia with a low white blood cell (WBC) count (3000 cells/\u03bcL; reference range, 4000\u20139000 cells/\u03bcL) and a low hemoglobin (Hb) level (10.3 g/dL; reference range, 12.0\u201315.2 g/dL). These abnormalities improved with nutritional therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient\u2019s weight had improved, with a BMI of approximately 17 kg/m2.\nAt 32 years of age, the patient\u2019s binge eating and purging behavior worsened again, and she began to lose weight. Five months prior to her eventual hospitalization (BMI, 15.0 kg/m2), no hematological abnormalities were identified. At 46 days prior to the hospitalization, because of ongoing fatigue, she was examined by a hematologist at our hospital. The patient was determined to be underweight, with a body weight of 31.9 kg and a BMI of 13.8 kg/m2. Peripheral blood analysis confirmed pancytopenia with the following findings: low WBC count, 2500 cells/\u03bcL; low neutrophil count, 1010 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1600\u20135400 cells/\u03bcL); low eosinophil count, 0 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 80\u2013610 cells/\u03bcL); low basophil count, 30 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 0\u2013180 cells/\u03bcL); normal lymphocyte count, 1280 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 1060\u20134190 cells/\u03bcL); normal monocyte count, 200 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 90\u2013690 cells/\u03bcL); low reticulocyte count, 14.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL (reference range: 35.0\u2013125.0 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL); low Hb level, 6.1 g/dL; high mean corpuscular volume, 113.9 fL (reference range: 80.0\u2013100.0 fL); and low platelet (Plt) count, 10.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL (reference range: 11.7\u201332.9 \u00d7 104 cells/dL). Blood biochemistry studies showed low serum levels of folate (3.0 ng/mL; reference range: 4.0\u201319.9 ng/mL) but normal serum levels of iron and vitamin B12. The etiology of pancytopenia was tentatively suspected to be folate deficiency, and thus the patient was prescribed folate at 10 mg/day. At 28 days prior to hospitalization, the folate level had recovered within normal limits, but the peripheral blood counts had worsened (low WBC count, 2200 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 2.5 g/dL; and low Plt count, 8.6 \u00d7 104 cells/dL).\nThe patient was temporarily admitted to the hematology department of our hospital for blood transfusions. Laboratory tests yielded negative results for autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus), malignant lymphoma, infectious diseases, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and hypersplenism. The patient was offered nutritional therapy to improve her weight but she refused and was therefore discharged following blood transfusions. After discharge, outpatient follow-up was performed by the hematology department. However, the patient\u2019s hematologic condition did not improve. Despite receiving blood transfusions twice monthly, the patient was eventually hospitalized once again for severe anemia. The patient believed that her hematological problems were not related with her eating behavior and persistently refused nutritional therapy. Finally, she was admitted to the psychiatric department to receive both hematologic and psychiatric support.\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s body weight was 30 kg and BMI was 13.0 kg/m2. The vital signs were normal. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities other than bilateral non-pitting edema of the lower legs. The patient received folate (10 mg/day), sertraline (50 mg/day), zolpidem (10 mg/day), and flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Toxicology analysis was not performed because the patient presented no feature indicating exposure to toxic compounds. Laboratory findings were as follows: low WBC count, 2100 cells/\u03bcL; low reticulocyte count, 9.4 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; low Hb level, 5.7 g/dL; and low Plt count, 4.1 \u00d7 104 cells/dL. The differential WBC count was normal. Serum levels of iron, folate, vitamin B12, zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin were within normal ranges. These results did not identify the etiology of the hematological problems. The patient persistently refused nutritional therapy and hoped that some other causes of pancytopenia (other than malnutrition) would be found. On hospitalization day 7, upon obtaining written informed consent from the patient, we performed bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\nBone marrow aspiration revealed low counts of nucleated cells (5.5 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 100\u2013200 \u00d7 103 cells/\u03bcL) and megakaryocytes (< 15.6 cells/\u03bcL; reference range: 50\u2013150 cells/\u03bcL). Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypoplasia but no dysplasia and confirmed the presence of fatty replacement with no gelatinous material (Fig. ). It was notable that the bone marrow displayed fatty marrow findings without any evidence of GMT, which would generally indicate IAA. Moreover, no chromosomal abnormalities or cell surface abnormalities were found upon bone marrow examination. T1-weighted images from thoracolumbar magnetic resonance imaging confirmed homogenous high signal intensity, characteristic of fatty marrow. Detailed examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow findings indicated IAA. However, despite the absence of bone marrow features typically seen in malnutrition, the patient\u2019s hematological abnormalities manifested after a decrease in body weight. Thus, although the biopsy findings indicated IAA, we considered that the nutritional etiology of pancytopenia could not be thoroughly ruled out.\nAfter bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, the patient accepted nutritional therapy. At the time of admission, she was given 600 kcal/day intravenously. Energy intake was gradually increased, and the patient received oral nutrition amounting to 3200 kcal/day from hospitalization day 14 until discharge. The patient\u2019s caloric intake was strictly managed, which resulted in weight restoration (Table ). The hematological abnormalities began to improve with the gradual increase in caloric intake. By hospitalization day 11, the patient\u2019s condition had improved to the point where she no longer required transfusions. On hospitalization day 28, the patient\u2019s weight was 38.1 kg, and her BMI was 16.5 kg/m2. Pancytopenia had also improved (Table ), and thus the patient was discharged the following day. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed 2 weeks after discharge yielded normal findings. Because both blood and bone marrow findings improved after implementation of nutritional therapy alone, the final diagnosis was pancytopenia secondary to malnutrition.", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Answer": "70.0", "LLM Explanation": "The patient's weight is 30 kg.

The patient had undergone a tonsillectomy under general anesthesia 8 years previously without any perioperative complication. The medical history indicated no drug or food allergies. Preoperative examinations of the patient were within normal limits. Therefore, anesthesia was applied according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification 1.\nThe patient received no premedication prior to admission to the operating theater. The blood pressure upon arrival in the operating theater was 158/76 mmHg, with a heart rate of 80 beats/min (BPM), and with a peripheral oxygen saturation of 99% of room air. Anesthesia was induced using an injection of 50 \u00b5g fentanyl, 150 mg propofol and 50 mg rocuronium. Endotracheal intubation was performed using a cuffed oral right-angle endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained using oxygen, air and desflurane. As a prophylactic antibiotic, 1 g cefazoline was administered intravenously immediately after completion of induction.\nOne hour after commencing surgery, the surgeon requested a reversal of the neuromuscular blockade to monitor patency of the facial nerve. Anesthesia was consequently maintained using desflurane alone. At this time, the blood pressure was 105/74 mmHg and the heart rate 92 BPM. We administered 1 mg atropine and 1.5 mg neostigmine intravenously to reverse neuromuscular blockade. After approximately 5 min, the blood pressure was decreased to 75/42 mmHg and the heart rate was 104 BPM. We administered 10 mg ephedrine intravenously. After 5 min, the blood pressure was 67/36 mmHg and the heart rate was 94 BPM. To manage persistent hypotension, 200 \u00b5g phenylephrine were administered, followed by a rapid infusion of lactated Ringer's solution. However, the non-invasive blood pressure decreased further to 57/36 mmHg and the heart rate rose to 138 BPM. As we asked the surgeon, there was no drug administration at surgical field.\nInvasive blood pressure monitoring was applied to the left dorsalis pedis artery and additional venous access was established. The arterial blood gas analysis showed all parameters to be within normal limits. Continuous infusion of norepinephrine at 0.03 \u00b5g/kg/min was initiated. Consequently, the blood pressure was restored to 99/51 mmHg and surgery was resumed.\nBecause the patient was covered with a drape, clinical manifestation of anaphylaxis, including skin rash, could not be observed. Approximately 1 h after the hypotension event, a skin rash was detected over the entire body. There were no respiratory symptoms, including wheezing or increased airway pressure. The patient was suspected to be suffering from an anaphylactic reaction. A 10 \u00b5g bolus of epinephrine was given and a continuous epinephrine infusion was initiated at 0.03 \u00b5g/kg/min. The patient responded to the epinephrine and soon maintained hemodynamic stability; with a blood pressure of 110/52 mmHg and a heart rate of 78 BPM. Norepinephrine infusion was discontinued and epinephrine infusion was tapered to maintain the restored blood pressure. The patient was treated using 4 mg chlorpheniramine together with 5 mg dexamethasone to prevent delayed reactions and halt any further histamine release. After 1.5 h, the blood pressure was 110/46 mmHg without any inotropic or vasopressor support. The skin lesion was improved and no respiratory symptoms were detected throughout the completion of the surgery. The total operation time was 200 min and the anesthesia time 245 min. The total infused crystalloid, colloid, estimated blood loss and urine output were 1,300 ml, 500 ml, 50 ml, and 450 ml, respectively ().\nThe patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and was placed on ventilatory support. An hour after arrival, the patient was extubated uneventfully without any neurologic deficit. Blood tests were obtained for the tryptase level, which was elevated to 37.9 \u00b5g/L (normal range: 0-11 \u00b5g/L) and the total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, which was increased to 675 Ku/L (normal range: negative). The patient was transferred to a general ward 1 day later and was discharged after 1 week without any complications. The consultant allergist recommended that allergen tests be conducted.\nSkin-prick and intradermal tests were performed after 1 month to determine the cause of the anaphylaxis.

The patient reported early satiety, a 30 lb. weight loss over 3 weeks and was unable to tolerate anything by mouth. Additionally, the patient had developed a left lateral neck mass which progressively increased in size over the past 9 months. Patient denied tenderness to palpation of the mass and dysphagia. His past medical history was significant for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, GERD, chronic hepatitis C, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). His past surgical history was remarkable for thyroid malignancy treatment with radioactive iodine and total thyroidectomy in addition to a gunshot wound. Family and social history were not significant. On physical exam, a left supraclavicular soft tissue mass 6 cm in diameter was appreciated, it was non-tender with no submandibular lymphadenopathy. A soft tissue mass was also palpable on the anterior abdominal wall in the epigastric region.\nGiven the patient's malignant history, significant weight loss in the past 3 weeks with increasing left mass size, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, the patient was admitted for further evaluation. Initial studies included ultrasound of the abdomen for workup of acute pancreatitis with findings unremarkable for the body of the pancreas and the head and tail not being visualized. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed pulmonary nodules in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe of the lung and bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe, PKD and bilateral hepatic cysts. Oncology was consulted, and a CT of the chest and neck were ordered in addition to a chest X-ray that was remarkable for two pulmonary nodules with an enlarged paratracheal node. Pulmonology was consulted, and the patient was recommended to follow-up in 6 months for surveillance of the pulmonary nodules. ENT and Surgery were consulted, and an excisional lymph node biopsy was pursued due to suspicion of possible recurrence of previous thyroid malignancy or metastases (). Histopathology revealed metastatic mucin-producing adenocarcinoma. Immunoperoxidase studies performed on paraffin sections revealed the neoplastic cells were positive for CK20 and CDX2. The cells were negative for CK7, TTF-1, p63, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (PACP), chromogranin, synaptophysin and S-100. Gastroenterology was consulted, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed including an antral biopsy of the gastric mucosa, which was unremarkable. Colonoscopy of the lower GI tract revealed a 6 cm obstructing mass in the transverse colon and a biopsy was taken revealing findings of invasive well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, focally present in subserosal tissue with ten of eleven regional lymph nodes involved. This confirmed the primary cancer originated from the colonic mass and metastasized to the left lateral neck mass (Virchow\u2019s node).\nSurgical intervention was pursued with resection of the transverse colon with primary end-to-end anastomosis. This resolved the intractable acute abdomen.

Impaired growth was noted (weight 39.5 kg; height 146 cm; BMI 17.6 kg/m). She had a heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 226/136 mmHg, respiration rate of 16 breaths per minute and arterial oxygen saturation of 96%. Blood analysis showed a serum creatinine level of 10.97 mg/dl (nv 0.5-1.1) and urea 109 mg/dL (nv 16-46) mmol/L. The patient also presented with bilateral AMLs, hypertension and seizure disorder. Her relatives reported difficulty in managing her home medications (antihypertensive and antiepileptic drugs) due to her intellectual disability. The patient had been diagnosed with TSC in childhood; there was a paternal family history of TSC. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) in end-stage renal failure appeared four years prior and the patient has been undergoing peritoneal dialysis since the diagnosis. At the age of 18 years, she underwent a prior unilateral endovascular embolization to treat renal aneurisms and the procedure successfully stopped a bleeding aneurism at the upper pole of the right kidney. Based on the patient\u2019s medical history, clinical and biochemical findings, a ruptured renal artery aneurysm was diagnosed. An urgent renal AE was considered the treatment of choice to limit hemorrhage and the risk of damage to the peritoneal dialysis catheter. The multidisciplinary team, including pediatric surgeons, interventional radiologists, pediatric nephrologists and psychologists agreed upon the choice to perform a bilateral renal AE in this complex patient. Prior to the intervention, and after being informed on the nature of the intervention, the patient and the patient\u2019s parents gave their written consent to undergo endovascular treatment. Under general anesthesia, ultrasound-guided right femoral common artery access was gained using a Terumo 6 FR 11 cm catheter. A diagnostic plain angiography scan revealed a double right renal artery. The major artery was easily catheterized with a 6 FR C2 Mac Boston-Scientific 6 F (65 cm) catheter. Through this catheter, a AMplatzer Plug-2 10 mm was released achieving artery occlusion (about 1 cm from the ostium, ). A Sim1 Boston-Scientific 5 fr was positioned in the lower right renal artery and several Terumo Azur coils were released (). Upon completion of the intervention, angiography confirmed the complete embolization of the vessels (). The same procedure was used for the left renal embolization using a Cobra C2 catheter and Terumo 4x10 mm Azur coils (). With the final angiography, bilateral renal arterialthrombosis was confirmed (about 1 cm from the ostium, ). The first cm of the renal artery was preserved to facilitate clamping during the future nephrectomy. After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit of our institution for observation and subsequently to the pediatric nephrology unit. Vital signs were monitored; her postoperative course was uneventful. Two months later, the patient underwent a bilateral lumbotomy and bilateral extraperitoneal nephrectomy to protect the peritoneal surface area and dialysis adequacy. Grossly, both kidneys were enlarged (left 14.5x7x6 cm; right 15x5x5.5 cm); macroscopically the tissue was almost entirely replaced by cysts alternating with solid grey and brown areas, on a background of soft and yellowish tissue with calcific deposits. Histologically, solid areas on the yellowish background were revealed to be angiomyolipoma, which extended to the adipose tissue, perirenal and the renal pelvis. Partially solid aspects (epithelioid angiomyolipoma) and partially cystic aspects (cysts with cubic or hobnail epithelium) were observed. In the right kidney, other solid greyish areas were observed (maximum diameter 15 mm); these were classified as renal cell carcinomas (RCC), with acinar, papillary and alveolar growth patterns and cribiform aspects, Furhrman grade III ().

Consequently, three years later, she underwent open surgical revision which was converted to an open RYGB with concomitant cholecystectomy. She had lost over 100 kg since the first bariatric procedure (166 kg preoperatively to 63 kg on presentation). However, she developed multiple complications, including chronic lower extremity lymphedema, small bowel obstruction requiring multiple surgical interventions, malabsorption secondary to short bowel syndrome, multiple vitamin deficiencies, wet beriberi requiring chronic thiamine replacement, osteoporosis causing a left hip fracture, and chronic low back pain.\nIn July 2018, she initially presented to the emergency department with increasing lower extremity edema secondary to chronic lymphedema.

Arterial blood gas analysis disclosed pH 6.60, PCO2 50 mm Hg, Po2 176 mm Hg, and HCO3 4.9 mEq/L on a Fio2 100%. Due to altered mental status, he was intubated and was subsequently transferred to our medical facility. On route, for the treatment of hyperkalemia, he was given 3 ampoules of sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, kayexalate, and insulin with dextrose water.\nSix hours after the incident, the patient was more alert and oriented and his leg pain had subsided. Details of smoking history could not be obtained due to the intubation. On physical examination, temperature was 35.8\u00b0C, heart rate 107 bpm, blood pressure 137/94 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 14 breaths/minute. He had regular heart rhythm, no murmur or pericardial rub. His abdomen was soft with active bowel sound. There were no symptoms and signs of limb ischemia on admission. He had no leg pain, pallor, poikilothermia, pulselessness, paresthesia, or paralysis. Motor power was at least grade 4 in all 4 extremities. His dorsalis pedis pulse was 2+ bilaterally. Initial investigations at our medical facility showed white blood cell 11400/\u00b5L, neutrophils 89%, hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 38.6%, platelet 159000/\u00b5L, blood urea nitrogen 29 mg/dL, creatinine 2.0 mg/dL, sodium 142 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mEq/L, chloride 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate 19 mEq/L, lactic acid 4.25 mmol/L, troponin T 0.1 ng/mL, and negative for acetone.

Computed tomography of head was performed and showed chronic right basal ganglion infarct. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and showed severely depressed left ventricular function with ejection fraction of less than 20%, grade II/IV diastolic dysfunction with mild TR, mild MR, and mild PR. Akinesis of the septal wall and hypokinesis of the anterolateral wall were present. Moreover, computed tomography of abdomen, pelvis, and chest without contrast revealed right lower lung consolidation with small right pleural effusion, moderately bilateral nonspecific perinephric fat stranding, submucosal fatty infiltration, and mild wall thickening of the descending colon down to the rectum. Subtle perirectal fat stranding was also visualized. Initially, he was treated with empiric antibiotics for possible pneumonia with severe sepsis with piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, and vancomycin. Aspirin and full-dose enoxaparin were started to cover possible acute coronary syndrome. Surgery was consulted due to a concern of bowel ischemia. Proctoscopy was done and showed normal pink rectal mucosa without blood in the vault.

Furthermore, her electrolytes were recorded as follows: random glucose 86 mg/dL, sodium 134 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L and bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Coagulation study revealed an INR of 1.0 and an APTT of 28 seconds. Other investigations including blood counts and liver functions tests were within normal range. The patient's daily urine output was 3.3 mL/kg/hour at this time. Urinalysis revealed small amounts of protein and blood in her urine. Staining for eosinophils on the random urine sample was positive.\nRenal biopsy was performed to further delineate the underlying cause of rapidly progressive renal insufficiency. Figure depicts the histological findings. The biopsy showed no evidence of glomerulonephritis. The interstitium was mildly edematous with small aggregates of inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were both negative for immune deposits. The histological findings were compatible with acute interstitial nephritis.\nThe patient was managed supportively by careful monitoring of fluid intake and output. Corticosteroids therapy was considered if no improvement of her renal function was observed.

The patient had history of old pulmonary tuberculosis, a cataract operation 10 years ago and several orthopedic surgeries for the fracture of both lower extremities due to a traffic accident 20 years ago. The patient had no diabetes, and hypertension. Familial history was unremarkable. Smoking history was 40 pack years, and the patient stopped smoking 12 years ago. He had 135 g of daily alcohol (three bottles of raw rice wine) consumption for 30 years. Alcohol intake was discontinued four years ago.\nChronic ill appearance, drowsy mental status, crusts and bruises of lower extremities, and abdominal distension without fluid wave shifting were noted on physical examinations. The patient did not complain of claudication ordinarily. His cirrhosis status was Child-Pugh B without ascites and hypersplenism-related pancytopenia. The initial vital signs were blood pressure 150/70 mmHg, heart rate 64 beats/min, respiration rate 20 breaths/min, and body temperature 36\u2103. The initial laboratory evaluation revealed WBC 26240 (poly: 85.6%) cells/\u00b5L, hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL, platelet 1.76\u00d7105 cells/\u00b5L, prothrombin time 14.7 seconds, international normalized ratio 1.26 (71%), ammonia 168 \u00b5mol/L, blood urea nitrogen 27.3 mg/dL, creatinine 3.16 mg/dL, albumin 2.83 g/dL, total bilirubin 2.11 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 34 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 16 U/L, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase 18 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 220 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 605 IU/L, Na 137 mEq/L, K 4.7 mEq/L, Cl 114 mEq/L, HCV RNA 1.9\u00d7105 copies/mL and metabolic acidosis. Urine sodium was 61 mEq/L with no proteinuria. Chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly and emphysematous change. Non-enhanced abdominal CT was unremarkable. Before admission, he had difficulty in defecation for 4 days. The first impression was grade III (graded with the West Haven Criteria) hepatic encephalopathy caused by constipation. Lactulose enema and administration of empirical antibiotics for infection of unknown origin related to leukocytosis were applied. And six months previously, his creatinine level was only 1.63 mg/dL. We suspected of type II hepatorenal syndrome overlapped with hepatic encephalopathy.\nAlthough the combination therapy of fluid replacement and diuretics started, his creatinine level was elevated to 4.02 mg/dL during 10 days. The urine output for 24 hours decreased to 500 mL. The patient was diagnosed with HRS on the basis of the criteria outlined by the International Ascites Club.\nOn the admission day 11, intravenous terlipressin along with albumin (20%, 100 mL) was administered for the management (1 mg q 4 hour) of HRS. He complained of severe cramping abdominal pain whenever a single injection of bolus terlipressin was administered. This complication was common, predictable, and thoroughly controlled by means of low-dose analgesics. Total urine output per 24 hours increased to 3,650 mL in 10 days when terlipressin was injected. On the admission day 22, the patient's clinical condition improved, and mentality changed to a clear state. The chemistry panel of the patient decreased: BUN to 30.63 mg/dL and creatinine to 1.29 mg/dL. However, on the day 11 after the terlipressin administration, the patient complained of severe tearing pain of both lower legs, and discoloration, necrosis, and gangrene were found in the 1st and 2nd toes of the right foot and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd toes of the left foot on physical examination. The terlipressin injection was discontinued immediately. These changes progressed to ischemia throughout the feet, accompanied by poor peripheral pulse and delayed wound healing as shown in .\nThe wounds in both feet were dressed with hydrocolloid solution. The patient still complained of continuous pain in both legs. A 3-phase bone scan showed an increased tracer uptake in the right 1st and 2nd toes, and the left toes and tarsal bone. The diagnosis assumed by the bone scan was osteomyelitis with osteonecrosis of the left foot, and osteomyelitis of the right foot (). However, 3-dimension angiographic CT of lower extremities was not taken due to the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.\nFor prevention of the enlargement of gangrene or necrosis and healing tissue damage, intravenous alprostadil (prostaglandin E1, 10 \u00b5g/day) was administered continuously. The patient's serum creatinine stabilized during alprostadil administration. On the 6th day after the administration of alprostadil, an oral sildenafil (cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, 50 mg q 12 hour) was added to promote the peripheral circulation. Two days later, his urine output decreased to 445 mL/24h. Serum creatinine level was elevated to 2.8 mg/dL again. The combination therapy of alprostadil and sildenafil was withdrawn promptly. Intravenous furosemide was reintroduced. One week later, the creatinine level decreased again to 1.3 mg/dL, and urine output was held at 2,000 mL/24h. The mental status and clinical condition improved well ().\nThough the lesions of the right 1st and 2nd toes were recovered completely by vigorous dressing and medication, the left three toes with severe necrosis and osteomyelitis needed to be amputated finally (). On the admission day 44, a 3-dimension angiographic CT of the lower extremities was taken. It showed moderate stenosis with multifocal calcified plaques at both femoral and popliteal arteries, and mild stenosis at both anterior tibial arteries.

The medications include losartan 50 mg, fenofibrate 160 mg and a combination capsule of simvastatin 20 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg. On routine checkup, his blood test results were as follows: fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 555 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 2.29 mg/dL; serum sodium, 140 mmol/L; serum triglycerides, 792 mg/dL; glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 14.9%. Review of his medical history revealed that he had high FPG levels 1 year prior to the consult during a routine checkup. Treatment had been recommended, but he did not undergo further workup.

He had mild myopia, with -3.25 diopters (D) of spherical equivalent in both eyes, which was the same as his own glasses. The lenses were clear in both eyes and the remainder of the ophthalmic examination findings were normal.\nThree days after the first visit, our patient presented with a sudden decrease in visual acuity and glare in both eyes that had begun 2 days prior to consult. Metformin hydrochloride (Glycomin tablet) 500 mg twice a day was prescribed. However, his blood glucose level was not optimally controlled, so he was prescribed insulin with titration. On the day he was treated with insulin and his blood glucose level began to be controlled, he felt an abrupt decrease in his visual acuity. His BCVA was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. A dilated slit-lamp examination showed fine feathery snowflake opacities in the posterior subcapsular region of bilateral lenses (Fig. ). Dilated fundus examination revealed some exudates and cotton wool patches from the macula to the mid-periphery region. Repeated blood test results on the same day showed a rapid decrease in FPG, which decreased to 214 mg/dL.

Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell count of 8,120/mm3, a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, a platelet count of 281,000/mm3, a blood sugar level of 99 mg/dL, a blood urea nitrogen level of 12.2 mg/dL, a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, a sodium level of 139 mEq/L, a potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, a chloride level of 104 mEq/L, a calcium level of 8.7 mg/dL, a phosphorous level of 3.6 mg/dL, and a magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL. Neither radiologic study nor neostigmine administration could be performed because of the risk to the fetus. Colonoscopy was performed to provide decompression because the patient's pain and distension worsened after 5 days of conservative care.

Subsequently, the patient presented aggressiveness and disorientation, where hypoglycemia was documented (33 mg/dL) and treated with dextrose 10% with complete symptom resolution.\nPhysical examination revealed cachectic facies, and an abdominal mass of approximately 13 cm located in epigastrium and right hypochondrium, associated with hepatomegaly. Initial laboratory were: white blood count of 9900/uL, neutrophils 8000/uL, lymphocytes 1700/uL, monocytes 300/uL, red blood cells 5,540,000/uL, hemoglobin 16.6 g/dL, hematocrit 49.6%, mean corpuscular volume 89.6 fL, platelet count 357,000/uL, international normalised ratio (INR) 1.05 (normal range (NR) 0.8-1.4), partial thromboplastin time 33 seconds (NR 25-35), serum potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 104 mmol/L (NR 98-107), sodium 141 mmol/L (NR 136-145), total bilirubin 1.01 mg/dL (NR 0.2-0.9), direct bilirubin 0.48 mg/dL (NR 0-0.3), alkaline phosphatase 404 U/L (NR 38-110), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 1017.6 U/L (NR 10-38), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 293 U/L (NR 120-246), alanine transaminase (ALT) 124 U/L (NR 9-52), aspartate transaminase (AST) 226 U/L (NR 14-36), serum creatinine 0.22 mg/dL (NR 0.5-0.8), serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) 23184.1 ng/mL (NR 0.8-1), carcinoembryonic antigen 0 ng/mL, CA 19-9 antigen 26.86 U/mL (NR 0-37), cortisol 8.9 ug/dL (NR 5.27-22.45), blood ketones 1.0 mg/dL (NR < 3.5), serum glucose 17 mg/dL (NR 74-106), baseline insulin 0.40 uU/mL (NR 2.6-24.9), IGF-I < 15 ng/mL (NR 45-210), C peptide 0.0407 ng/mL (NR 1.1-4.4), IgM antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen non-reactive, antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen < 3.10 mUI/mL (NR 0-10), antibodies against hepatitis C non-reactive, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) > 1000 (NR 0-1). Given our patient\u2019s profile, a \u201cbig\u201d IGF-II measurement was attempted, but the assay is not available in Colombia. Therefore, hypoglycemia due to tumor consumption vs paraneoplastic hypoglycemia due to \u201cbig\u201d-IGF II production were the suspected diagnoses. The patient required treatment with 50% dextrose in continuous infusion to achieve normal blood glucose and to remain symptom free.\nA positron emission tomography (PET/CT) with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) was performed (Figure ), where multiple hypermetabolic hepatic masses were observed, in both hepatic lobules; the high uptake index suggested an elevated glucose consumption tumor. Liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of trabecular and fibrolamellar hepatocarcinoma (Figure ). Given the size and presence of metastatic disease, the patient was not a candidate for surgical treatment; transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was done twice with partial improvement, but the dextrose infusion could not be stopped. A glucagon therapeutic test was performed, with inadequate response. Thereafter, an OctreoScan was performed (Figure ) to determine if the patient could benefit from somatostatin analogs, but uptake was observed in a pulmonary metastasis only, reducing success probability with such therapy. Finally, despite different interventions, hypoglycemia control could not be achieved and, consequently, parenteral nutrition with a high dextrose load was started to continue ambulatory palliative care.", "Question": "What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?", "LLM Answer": "139.008", "LLM Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.\\nThe concentration of sodium is 141 mEq/L. \\nThe concentration of glucose is 17 mg/dL. \\nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 141 mEq/L + 0.024 * (17 - 100) = 141 mEq/L - 0.024 * 83 = 141 mEq/L - 1.992 = 139.008 mEq/L.\\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 139.008 mEq/L.", "Ground Truth Answer": "139.392", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.\nThe concentration of sodium is 141.0 mmol/L.

She did not have a family history of diabetes or previous autoimmune diseases. She mentioned multiple hospitalizations due chronic idiopathic pancreatitis between 12 and 16 years of age. At that time, laboratory tests ruled out the presence of gallstones, tumors, autoimmune diseases, or metabolic diseases. Her pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions were completely normal after each episode. Fifteen years after the last episode of pancreatitis, she presented with alopecia, malar rash, and oral ulcers. She was initially diagnosed as having discoid lupus with the skin biopsy results. However, a week later, she developed severe neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE, including focal motor seizures, with a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score of 18 points. Rheumatologists prescribed methylprednisolone (three doses of 1 g daily by intravenous injection) with improvement of neurological symptoms. Her treatment at hospital discharge was: chloroquine (225 mg/day), levetiracetam (1.5 g twice a day), phenytoin (100 mg twice a day), lorazepam (1 mg/day), and a monthly bolus of CY. In addition, she was treated with weekly down-titrating doses of prednisone (initial dose of 1 mg/kg).\nSeven days after administration of the sixth dose of CY (cumulative dose of 6.25 g), she presented with asthenia, adynamia, polydipsia, nausea and vomiting, food intolerance, impaired visual acuity, and abdominal pain. The physical examination at our ED revealed tachycardia (125 beats per minute), tachypnea (27 breaths per minute), drowsiness, and dehydration. She presented with a normal body mass index and no stigmata associated with insulin resistance. Laboratory tests reported: serum glucose of 1240 mg/dl, sodium of 127 mEq/L, potassium of 5.56 mEq/L, chlorine of 86 mEq/L, arterial pH of 7.07, bicarbonate of 3.00 mmol/L, and ketonuria (80 mg/dl) with effective serum osmolarity of 322.8 mOsm/kg and total osmolarity of 334.1 mOsm/kg, with an anion gap of 43.56, urea 63 mg/dl, and creatinine of 1.58 mg/dl. Liver tests, amylase, and lipase were normal. After the diagnosis of a mixed hyperglycemic state with predominance of severe DKA, she was started on an aggressive intravenously administered fluid schedule with saline solution 0.9% and intravenous continuous insulin infusion (CII). During the first day she required a total of 165 units of insulin per day (2.75 U/kg per day). Table shows the clinical and biochemical evolution from first evaluation to resolution of DKA.\nDuring the first hours, traditional precipitant factors for DKA, such as infections or cardiac ischemia were ruled out. With an aliquot from the first serum sample in the ED, we measured anti-insulin, anti-GAD65, and anti-IA2 antibodies that were reported as negative; C-peptide was determined to be 0.5 ng/ml and the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 12.0%. The diagnostic consideration was of T1DM, so once DKA remission was achieved, she was prescribed an intensive insulin scheme at a dose of 1.09 IU/kg per day with 70% of basal insulin glargine daily and 30% of lispro boluses divided in three doses.\nWith the multi-drug immunosuppressive treatment her symptoms improved and 3 months after discharge the CY was switched to azathioprine and then to chloroquine. Three weeks after the switch from CY to other immunosuppressive therapies, she presented with symptomatic hypoglycemia and insulin doses were tapered down. Five months after the switch, insulin was completely withdrawn. At last follow up, 1 year after the hyperglycemic crisis, she had no symptoms related to hyperglycemia and her blood glucose remains under 100 mg/dl.

He was maintained on salbutamol inhaler, fluticasone, and salmetrol discus inhaler, theophylline and home oxygen therapy. He denied receiving systemic corticosteroids in the preceding year. He was an ex-smoker and alcohol drinker. Physical examination on admission revealed an ill looking, dyspneic patient with a temperature 38.4\u00b0C, blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg, pulse rate 160/minute, and respiratory rate 36/minute. Chest examination revealed expiratory wheezes and bilateral basal crepitations. Otherwise, physical examination was unremarkable.

Sputum culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sensitive to cefipime and ciprofloxacin; however, it was thought to represent colonization. A diagnosis of COPD with acute exacerbation was made, for which he was given intravenous ceftriaxone 2 gm once daily, azithromycin 500 mg once daily, methylprednisolone 40 mg three times daily, and salbutamol and ipratropium bromide nebulizers. He made a gradual improvement, and after seven days he was shifted to oral prednisolone 40 mg once daily and oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to complete two weeks of antibiotics.

Cytologic examination of the bronchial wash and lavage revealed bronchial epithelial cells, few squamous cells in the background of numerous S stercoralis worms () and bacteria with inflammatory cells and blood. Transbronchial biopsy showed only intraalveolar hemorrhage with anthracotic pigments, but was negative for granuloma, viral inclusions, or malignancy. He was treated with oral ivermectin 12mg once daily. Two days later he complained of vomiting, lower abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and constipation. Physical examination revealed abdominal distention, lower abdominal tenderness, and sluggish bowel sounds. A plain radiograph of the abdomen revealed distended bowel loops but no air fluid levels.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 129.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 129.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 129.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 129.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 129.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 11.4 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 11.4 mmol.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 490.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (490.0 - 100) = 146.36 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 146.36 mEq/L.", "Result": "Correct", "Model": "gpt-4o", "Error": null}

Abdomen examination showed hepatospenomegaly (liver on left side and spleen on right side) and umbilical hernia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) displayed inverted P waves in I, aVL and aVR, which were suggestive of situs inversus. Chest X-ray revealed evidence of bronchopneumonia and the cardiac shadow was on the right side. Ultrasonography abdomen also indicated situs inversus. Echocardiography was suggestive of situs inversus with dextrocardia with normal cardiac anatomy. Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan was indicative of extra hepatic biliary atresia (EHBA) with the liver in left upper abdomen. Child was diagnosed as situs inversus with dextrocardia, bronchopneumonia, and extrahepatic biliary atresia.\nBronchopneumonia was managed with intravenous antibiotics, paracetamol, and steam inhalation. The child was placed on therapy with oral phenoparbitone 10 mg twice a day and intravenous Vitamin K 5 mg once a day for 10 days. Investigations revealed hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL, total leucocyte count (TLC) 17400/mm3, platelet count 4.5 lac/mm3, serum sodium 131 meq/L, serum potassium 4.4 meq/L, random blood sugar 70 mg/dL, serum bilirubin 19.2 mg/dL (normal 0.2-1.2) (direct-12, indirect 7.2), SGOT 148IU/L (normal 15-50) , SGPT 93 IU/L (normal 15-50), alkaline phosphatase 1232 IU/L (normal 50-300), blood urea 18 mg/dL (15-45), serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dL (0.6-1.2), prothrombin time (PT) 11.3 sec (test), 12 sec (control), and aPTT test 38.7 sec Control 29 sec (normal 20-40 sec). The child was listed for corrective biliary surgery.\nThe operating room was kept warm prior to shifting of the child. In the operating room, routine monitors (electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, non invasive blood pressure) were attached. Left-sided ECG leads were attached on the right side and vice versa. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous fentanyl (9 \u03bcg) and thiopentone (25 mg), and lungs were ventilated with isoflurane in oxygen and nitrous oxide (50:50) (MAC 1.2) using Jackson Rees modification of Ayre's T piece. After achieving neuromuscular blockade with atracurium (2.5 mg), trachea was intubated with endotracheal tube size 3.5 mm ID. Capnography and temperature monitoring was also initiated. Urethra was catheterized and urinary output was monitored. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane in oxygen and nitrous oxide (50:50) (MAC 1) using paediatric close circuit along with boluses of atracurium (0.5 mg) and fentanyl (1 \u03bcg) as required. The child was kept warm using warm fluids, warming mattress and by adequately covering the child with cotton.\nThe surgeon found the liver on left side with right lobe on the left side, malrotated gut (caecum, appendix on the left side), two atretic gall bladders, annular pancreas with preduodenal portal vein, cirrhotic enlarged liver, and a multi-lobulated spleen. Hepatic roux-en-y portoenterostomy with Ladd's procedure was done. The surgical incision site was infiltrated with 6 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine. The hydration was maintained using normal saline. The surgery lasted 5 hours, and blood loss of 100 mL was replaced with packed red blood cells.\nAt the end of surgery, the airway resistance increased. The airway pressures increased from 18 cm H2O to 28 cm H2O. Endotracheal tube suctioning was done. On auscultation, breath sound was reduced on the right lung fields. Repeat suction was done. We suspected a mucus plug to be obstructing the endotracheal tube and changed the tube after repeat laryngoscopy. A mucus plug was seen at the tip of the tube. The ventilation became better. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed and trachea was extubated. The child had good respiratory efforts with bilateral equal air entry. The child was shifted to the pediatric intensive care unit for further management. The child was nursed in the incubator and ECG and pulse oximeter monitoring were continued. The vitals and urinary output were within normal limits. The humidified oxygen was supplemented using an oxygen hood. The postoperative hemoglobin was 9.9 g/dL. The serum electrolytes were normal. The analgesia was provided with rectal paracetamol suppository.

This will result to 308.0 mg bun/10.0 dL = 30.8 mg bun/dL. The concentration value of 11.4 mmol bun/L converts to 30.8 mg bun/dL. \nThe concentration of glucose is 6.6 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 6.6 mmol. To convert 6.6 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 6.6 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.007 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.007 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 1.261 g glucose. To convert 1.261 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.261 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 1261.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1261.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 126.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 6.6 mmol glucose/L converts to 126.1 mg glucose/dL. \nPlugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 131.0 + (30.8 / 2.8) + (30.8 / 18) = 280.006 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 280.006 mmol/L.

The patient received his second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine two days prior to admission. The next day he developed generalized body aches, nausea, and an episode of vomiting. He denied any fevers or chills. Though he normally ambulates independently, he was unable to stand or get out of bed due to weakness and generalized pain when he woke up the morning of admission. His admission medications included alogliptin, empagliflozin, insulin aspart, insulin glargine, losartan, metformin, pioglitazone, and tamsulosin. He reports no recent changes in medications or intake of over-the-counter medications. Past medical history was significant for COVID-19 infection three months prior, which required hospitalization for 13 days and treatment with convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone, according to institutional standard treatment protocols at the time.\nOn exam, vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 87/minute, temperature of 98.4\u00b0 F, and respiratory rate of 16/minute. He was in no acute distress. His strength was normal and symmetric bilaterally, cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact, and sensory was intact to light touch bilaterally. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was negative for ischemia. Troponins, a respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel including influenza, and COVID-19 PCR were negative.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated by EMS upon arrival for pulseless electrical activity, and after eight minutes the patient achieved return of spontaneous circulation. She was subsequently intubated without the need for induction medications and transported to the emergency department (ED). Upon arrival to the ED, an initial physical exam revealed an intubated, unresponsive child with markedly diminished lung sounds bilaterally without wheezing, and an oxygen saturation of 60% on 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Additionally, respiratory therapy reported extreme difficulty with ventilation. Initial bedside chest radiographs (CXR) () were obtained and showed evidence suggestive of bilateral pneumothoraces, which in conjunction with the patient\u2019s clinical picture prompted bilateral chest tube placement. Both returned large volumes of serous fluid, although no blood or air.\nContinuation of the primary survey revealed tachycardia at 132 beats per minute with strong and regular peripheral pulses in all extremities. There was no jugular venous distention. The abdomen was soft without masses. A limited neurologic exam revealed bilateral sluggish pupils, with the right pupil at 6 millimeters (mm) and the left pupil at 3 mm. There were no obvious signs of trauma, and no dermatologic findings.\nAfter initial stabilization, collateral history was obtained from the mother who stated the patient had been feeling tired with intermittent fevers over the prior few days, which led to a diagnosis of mild viral pneumonia by her outpatient pediatrician. Per her electronic health record, this was based on the patient\u2019s age, gradual onset of symptoms with non-toxic appearance, and non-focal pulmonary findings on auscultation. Imaging and medications were therefore deferred, but return precautions were given should the patient\u2019s clinical presentation worsen. With regard to her asthma, the patient had only occasionally used an inhaler for night-time coughing but otherwise had never been admitted, intubated, or prescribed oral steroids. She additionally denied any other known medical conditions, surgical history, allergies, or red flags to suggest the potential for non-accidental trauma.\nShortly thereafter, initial laboratory values resulted in a white blood cell count of 428,000 per milliliter (/mL) (4,400\u201312,900/mL) with a 96% blast differential, hemoglobin of 6.7 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (11.4\u201314.3 g/dL), and platelet count of 27,000/mL (187,000\u2013445,000/mL).

Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate. Urinalysis indicated the presence of ketones and glucose. Endocrinologic assessments showed 0.26 ng/mL C-peptide (normal range, 0.6\u20132.3 ng/mL) and 15.7% glycosylated hemoglobin. Antiglutamic acid decarboxylase was positive (1.72 U/mL; range, 0\u20131 U/mL), whereas anti-islet cell and anti-insulin antibodies were negative. These findings indicated a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and severe DKA. The main metabolic data during hospitalization are shown in . Fluid (0.45% saline) and continuous intravenous insulin infusion therapy were initiated at a rate of 0.05 unit/kg/hr immediately according to DKA treatment protocol []. Hourly neurological evaluations were performed for signs of cerebral edema. Although the patient remained drowsy, signs of cerebral edema were not evident. The patient suffered a <1 min generalized tonic seizure at 4 hours postadmission that was followed by bradycardia and cardiopulmonary arrest. External cardiac massage was initiated, followed by one epinephrine injection. Spontaneous circulation resumed after 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Laboratory data after return of spontaneous circulation showed metabolic acidosis and hypophosphatemia (pH, 7.05; PCO2, 23.6 mmHg; PO2, 181 mmHg; HCO3, 6.7 mmol/L; glucose, 517 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 136 mmol/L; potassium, 3.2 mmol/L; corrected calcium, 8.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 1.2 mg/dL). The patient received K2HPO4 and KCl to achieve 1.9 mEq/kg/day of phosphorus after the cardiac arrest. A brain computed tomographic (CT) scan showed no brain edema or intracranial pathology. Dexamethasone and mannitol were prescribed for prevention of brain edema and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Although the patient remained drowsy (GCS=14 [--]), vital signs were stable. At 16 hours after initiation of DKA treatment, the patient became stuporous (GCS=9 [--]) with shallow, weak, and slow respiration that necessitated endotracheal intubation. Blood tests at this time revealed respiratory acidosis and severe hypophosphatemia (pH, 6.80; PCO2, 92.9 mmHg; PO2, 160.3 mmHg; HCO3, 14.6 mmol/L; glucose, 375 mg/dL; corrected sodium, 142 mmol/L; potassium, 2.8 mmol/L; phosphate, 0.4 mg/dL; lactate, 0.6 mmol/L). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL). Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 5.7 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. Fluid replacement with potassium and phosphate, and continuous intravenous insulin administration was maintained until laboratory findings were normal. On the third day, the patient\u2019s vital signs were stable, self-respiration was recovered, arterial blood gas levels were normal (pH, 7.39; PCO2, 25.2 mmHg; PO2, 139.3 mmHg; HCO3, 15.6 mmol/L), and plasma phosphate had risen (3.5 mg/dL). Weaning from inotropic and ventilator supports was possible. The patient was transferred to the general ward the next day. On the fourth day of hospitalization, oral feeding and multiple subcutaneous insulin injections were started and phosphate supplementation was stopped. An electroencephalogram showed no epileptiform discharges or slow waves. The patient was discharged on day 10 with no neurologic complications. The patient was followed up regularly. No neurologic complications or respiratory problems were noted, and the patient did not require further phosphate supplementation.\nThis study approval and informed consent were waived by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital.", "Question": "What is the patient's serum osmolality in terms of mOsm/kg?", "LLM Answer": "306.86", "LLM Explanation": "The formula for calculating serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, BUN is in mg/dL, and glucose is in mg/dL. \\nFrom the patient note, the corrected sodium is 133 mmol/L, BUN is 25.9 mg/dL, and glucose is 569 mg/dL. \\nPlug these values into the formula: \\n2 * 133 + (25.9 / 2.8) + (569 / 18) = 266 + 9.25 + 31.61 = 306.86 mOsm/kg. \\nTherefore, the patient's serum osmolality is 306.86 mOsm/kg.", "Ground Truth Answer": "303.028", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing serum osmolality is 2 * Na + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18), where Na is the concentration of sodium in mmol/L, the concentration of BUN is in mg/dL, and the concentration of glucose is in mg/dL.\nThe concentration of sodium is 133.0 mmol/L. \nThe concentration of bun is 25.9 mg/dL. \nThe concentration of glucose is 500.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 133.0 + (25.9 / 2.8) + (25.9 / 18) = 303.028 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 303.028 mmol/L.

The symptoms started a month prior for which she visited her primary medical doctor and was treated for pneumonia. Her symptoms continued to persist and gradually worsen at which point she was also treated with tamiflu for influenza. Her other symptoms however continued to progress and consisted of fever, chills, cough, body aches, and shortness of breath. The patient is a non-smoker, drinks alcohol socially, and works in a pharmacy.\nOn physical examination, the patient was tachycardia with a heart rate of 118, blood pressure of 111/72, respiratory rate of 24, and was saturating 88% on room air. At the time, she was afebrile with a temperature of 99.1 \u00b0F. Significant findings on examination showed diffuse rhonchi bilaterally with crackles on lung examination. Laboratory data demonstrated hemoglobin of 13, hematocrit of 39, white blood cell of 10.9, and platelets of 344,000. Sodium was 136, potassium 3.8, chloride 98, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 15, creatinine 1.0, and glucose of 113. Troponins were negative. D-dimer was elevated at 0.71 and CT angiogram (CTA) was conducted to rule out pulmonary embolism. CTA of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed tree-in bud changes in the right upper lobe suspicious for an infectious or inflammatory process (). Similar findings were also seen in the right lower lobe. There were linear changes in the lower lobes bilaterally which most likely represented atelectasis and there was a 7.6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.\nThe patient was admitted to telemetry for the management of pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone initially. Patient was found to be positive for Mycoplasma pneumonia and medications were adjusted accordingly. Patient continued to have persistent hypoxia and continued to desaturate to 88% upon ambulation. She was later found to have hemophilus influenza growth in sputum culture, which was properly being managed by her antibiotic regimen. During her hospital stay, although the patient was receiving solumedrol and antibiotics she continued to have diffuse bilateral crackles and productive cough. Patient was found to have leukocytosis as high as 19.6, but this could be attributed to her steroid treatment. However, this train of thought remained unclear as the patient was also found to have a bandemia of 21. Her antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were adjusted to consist of doxycycline, zyvox, and fluconazole. The patient continued to deteriorate and systemic workup including allergy test, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (cANCA), perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), purified protein derivative (PPD), QuantiFERON, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test was all conducted. Full systemic workup returned negative for any findings. After completing her course of antibiotics, she was also removed from her steroids but would continue to desaturate and lung findings remained unchanged. Patient underwent bronchoscopy but no significant mass or lesion was found to biopsy and her postoperative diagnosis remained as non-resolving pneumonia. Repeat CT scan was performed which showed minimal improvement and continue to suggest pneumonia and possibly underlying interstitial lung disease ().\nThe patient was scheduled for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure with biopsy of the right middle and lower lobes. Right lower lobe wedge biopsy on pathology showed lung parenchyma with consolidation, atelectasis, and areas of fibrosis (). Right mid lung biopsy also showed foci of consolidation but also consisted of varying stages of questionable emphysema (). As the findings were highly unusual and emphysematous changes were not found on patient\u2019s CT scans, the pathology was sent to a specialist, who confirmed the results but again noted them to be very non-specific. The patient\u2019s post-operative status was complicated and patient desaturated overnight and required intubation. Alpha-1 antitrypsin was sent but returned elevated. The patient was successfully extubated after 2 days. She was placed back on steroids and was clinically improving over the course of another 1 week. Her pulse oximetry however on room air remained around 86% even after a week of steroids and thus the patient would be discharged on home oxygen therapy. Pulmonary function tests were significant for a forced vital capacity (FVC) moderately reduced at 1.65 L (60%), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) severely reduced at 0.98 L (40%), FEV1/FVC ratio reduced at 59%, and MVV severely reduced at 28%. Flow volume loop demonstrated a combined obstructive and restrictive contour (). Lung volumes showed a vital capacity reduced at 1.65 L (60%), total lung capacity (TLC) reduced at 2.08 L (56%), and residual volume (RV) reduced at 0.43 L (43%).

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 125.0 mEq. To convert from 125.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 125.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 125.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 125.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 125.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 125.0 mmol sodium/L. \nThe concentration of bun is 45.0 mg/dL. \nThe concentration of glucose is 400.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 125.0 + (45.0 / 2.8) + (45.0 / 18) = 288.294 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 288.294 mmol/L.

There were no signs of systemic illness. He had multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus controlled with diet and exercise, peripheral neuropathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic bronchitis, and congestive heart failure. He reported incurring a small skin tear secondary to a fall 2 months prior. However, the wound had acutely worsened after being discharged from an outside hospital 4 days prior. The primary reason for admission had been confusion and generalized weakness attributed to pneumonia and worsening CKD. However, he also received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime due to concern for cellulitis. At admission, tibia/fibula radiographs showed soft tissue irregularity consistent with superficial ulceration and no features of osteomyelitis. Intravenous doxycycline was initiated for empiric coverage. Surgical debridement on the 2nd day of admission (DOA), revealed frank purulence beneath the eschar with necrotic tissue throughout the entire anterior compartment down to tibial periosteum (). At this time, preliminary culture results revealed light growth of fungus, yeast, and coagulase negative staphylococcus. Intravenous fluconazole was added to the patient's medication regimen until further speciation results became available. On DOA 6, final culture results identified the fungus as Rhizopus. On DOA 7, preliminary pathology found marked necrosis and invasive fungal infection with hyphae; thus, the antifungal was changed to micafungin. On DOA 8, final pathology revealed features suggestive of mucormycosis including numerous irregularly shaped hyphae, scattered necrotic-appearing vessels, diffuse Periodic acid-Schiff staining, and poor Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver staining. However, micafungin was maintained in effort to spare the patient's remaining renal function as there was no fungal growth on repeat cultures. After consultation with dermatology and nephrology, it was ultimately decided that the benefits outweighed the risks. Thus, the antifungal regimen was changed to liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) on DOA 10. Despite continued aggressive debridement, LAmB, and the addition of isavuconazole, repeat pathology on DOA 21 and 27 both showed invasive mucormycosis throughout the soft tissue. Due to continued positive margins after serial debridement, worsening appearance, and after consultation with the mycology division at the National Institutes of Health, a knee disarticulation was performed on DOA 39.

Patient has no history of liver disease. Upper GI endoscopy, which is a part of our preoperative workup, was performed in this patient as in all patients. Endoscopy revealed 2 separate 4-5 mm nodular lesions in gastric corpus and antrum localization (). Biopsies were taken from two lesions separately. Other stomach areas were in normal appearance. Both lesions were reported as neuroendocrine tumor. Immunohistochemically; chromogranin A and synaptophysin was reported positive. KI proliferation index was reported as 4 %. Both tumors were reported as having similar characteristics (WHO grade 2). On biopsy specimens taken from stomach corpus, inactive chronic gastritis and incomplete type focal intestinal metaplasia in the environment was detected. The patient's serum gastrin level was checked and it was detected as high (gastrin level 660). It was decided that Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) would be performed on the patient because both lesion areas would remain in the extracted part of the stomach. The patient underwent a sleeve gastrectomy. In addition, intraoperative endoscopy was performed to ensure complete removal of the lesions. When the extracted specimen was opened, both lesions were removed at a distance from the stapler line. The patient was discharged on the 3rd day with liquid diet in accordance with our routine protocol. There were no complications.

Laboratory results were significant for an elevated leukocyte count of 18.9 \u00d7 103 thousand per millimeters cubed (K/mm3) (reference range: 4.5\u201311.0 K/mm3), hemoglobin of 16.4 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (12.0\u201316.0 g/dL), creatinine of 1.7 milligrams (mg)/dL (0.5\u20131.4 mg/dL), and lipase of 844 U/L (73\u2013393 U/L). Initial imaging via computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed gastric pneumatosis extending into the distal esophagus with extensive portal venous air, diverticulosis, multiple left renal cysts, and a 5.8-centimeter (cm) adrenal myolipoma ().\nGiven the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms combined with the CT findings of gastric pneumatosis, the poison center and gastroenterology were consulted. The patient was admitted for observation with plans for an endoscopy; however, upon surgical consultation, he was emergently transferred to a tertiary care hospital due to concerns for a potential perforation and necrosis of the gastric body and distal esophagus, which may have necessitated a total gastrectomy as well as distal esophagectomy. The patient had been placed on a nothing-by-mouth restriction on admission and was hemodynamically stable on intravenous (IV) fluids, pantoprazole IV drip, and piperacillin-tazobactam at time of transfer.\nUpon arrival at the tertiary center, the patient reported overall improvement of his abdominal pain and sore mouth. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed there confirmed moderate to severe distal esophagitis and severe pangastritis but no evidence of necrosis, linear ulcerations along the lesser curvature, or mild bulbar duodenitis. Gastric biopsy later demonstrated fundic type gastric mucosa with acute inflammation and epithelial erosion. Following his endoscopy, the patient tolerated clear liquids and had his diet advanced to surgical soft. He remained pain-free and was deemed stable for discharge on the third day with recommendations for a repeat endoscopy in two to three months.", "Question": "What is the patient's FeverPAIN score?", "LLM Answer": "0", "LLM Explanation": "The FeverPAIN score is used to assess the likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis based on specific symptoms.

This had developed over a 7-day period and was associated with a fever and odynophagia of solids and liquids. Her symptoms had failed to improve despite a four-day course of benzylpenicillin 500 mg qds and a two-day course of metronidazole 400 mg tds. The patient reported no past medical history but revealed that she had suffered from bulimia for 15 years although general practitioner review had declined further contact with the psychiatric services because of difficult previous experiences with them. She described fortnightly purging following eating during the previous 6 months, which was followed by episodes of tonsillitis. She used no regular medications. ENT examination revealed bilaterally enlarged, erythematous tonsils, and jugulodigastric lymphadenopathy. No peri-tonsillar abscess was present. Ear examination and nose examination were normal. Blood testing was normal throughout. IgM screen was negative. The patient was admitted to our ENT service for intravenous antibiotic therapy. The patient declined followup for consideration of a tonsillectomy as she was moving to a different region.
