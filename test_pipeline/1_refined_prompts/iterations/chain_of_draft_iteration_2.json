  "prompt": "**Refined Prompt for Medical Calculation and Clinical Reasoning:**\n\n**Task Objective:** Accurately calculate a specified medical score or measurement based on patient notes using structured reasoning.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Understand the Task:**\n   - Identify and extract all relevant data from the patient note necessary for the calculation.\n   - Ensure no essential information is overlooked.\n\n2. **Structured Reasoning Process:**\n   - Divide the calculation into clear, concise steps.\n   - Limit each step to 5-7 words, ensuring clarity and brevity.\n   - Use symbols, equations, or shorthand effectively to maintain precision.\n\n3. **Output Format:**\n   - Record your reasoning process as a string, highlighting key steps and decisions.\n   - Clearly present the final score or measurement in a JSON dict.\n\n4. **Focus on Precision and Accuracy:**\n   - Exclude irrelevant information; focus only on data pertinent to the calculation.\n   - Emphasize precise mathematical operations and transformations.\n   - Ensure logical progression through clearly defined steps.\n\n5. **Example of Structured Reasoning:**\n   - \"Age > 75; add 2 points\"\n   - \"History of stroke; add 2 points\"\n   - \"Final Score = 4\"\n\n**Output the JSON dict as follows:**\n```json\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insert your step-by-step thinking here.\",\n  \"answer\": \"Insert final score here.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Reminder:** Enhance clarity and accuracy by maintaining a balance between brevity and detail in each calculation step. Double-check all extracted data for accuracy before proceeding with calculations.",
