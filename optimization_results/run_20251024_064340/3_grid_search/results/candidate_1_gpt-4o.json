        "Patient Note": "A 26-year-old Sinhalese woman was transferred from a local hospital with a history of reduced urine output, shortness of breath, reduced level of consciousness, abdominal pain, vomiting, and mild degree fever of 2 days\u2019 duration. Her bilateral lower limbs were edematous but she was not pale or icteric. Her pulse rate was 112 beats per minute and blood pressure was 140/70 mmHg. An abdominal examination did not reveal organomegaly. Bilateral lower zone crepitations were noted on lung auscultation. Her respiratory rate was 20 cycles per minute and oxygen saturation was 97% on air. She had right-sided lower motor type facial nerve palsy. Glasgow Coma Scale was 13/15. The rest of the neurological examination including other cranial nerves and ophthalmoscope examination was unremarkable.\nOur initial working diagnosis was leptospirosis with acute kidney injury and treatment was initiated accordingly (intravenously administered antibiotic and hemodialysis via femoral vascular catheter), but we could not explain the cranial nerve involvement. The following day she came out with the history of a suicide attempt in which she had self-ingested brake oil (amount not clear) after a conflict with her husband.\nOn admission her renal functions were deranged with serum creatinine of 352 \u03bcmol/ L, blood urea of 14.1 mmol/l, Na+ 140 mmol/l, and K 5.2 mmol/l. Arterial blood gas showed pH 7.08, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) 94, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) 28, bicarbonate (HCO3) 13.8, and base excess \u2212 18 mEq per liter. Her serum osmolality was 339 mosmols with an osmolar gap of 20 mOsm/kg and anion gap was 32 mEq/l. Although relevant, her urine was not examined for calcium oxalate crystals. Full blood count showed hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dl, platelet of 185 \u00d7 106/L, and white cell count of 15.2 \u00d7 106/L. Her C-reactive protein was 22 mg/dl. Her random blood sugar was 92 mg/dl. Her blood and urine cultures were negative. Her pro-calcitonin levels were within normal range. A chest X-ray did not reveal any abnormality such as consolidation or pleural effusion. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of her brain was normal. Leptospira antibody tested after 10 days of disease was negative. She was started on initial consecutive daily dialysis followed by every other day dialysis which yielded a considerable improvement in renal functions. After 10 days of hospital stay she was discharged with residual facial nerve palsy. Over the course of 3 months\u2019 clinic follow-up she had complete renal and neurological improvement.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?",
        "LLM Answer": "139.808",
        "LLM Explanation": "Serum sodium = 140 mEq/L, Serum glucose = 92 mg/dL, Correction formula: Na_corrected = Na_measured + 0.024 * (Glucose - 100), Apply formula: 140 + 0.024 * (92 - 100) = 140 - 0.192 = 139.808.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "139.808",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.\nThe concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 92.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (92.0 - 100) = 139.808 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 139.808 mEq/L.",

        "Patient Note": "The 7-year- and 6-month-old boy was born from a 29-year-old mother. The family had no consanguinity and no specific remarkable family history of seizure, delayed development, hypotonia, or language delay. His 24-month-old younger brother was healthy.\nThe patient was transferred from a local clinic for the evaluation of heart murmur at 9 days of life. At that time, a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 4.2 mm in size, a small secundum atrial septal defect, and a small apical muscular ventricular septal defect were detected by Doppler echocardiography. The patient weighed 3.3 kg (less than 3rd percentile) and had a length of 53.1 cm (10th\u201325th percentile). During the follow-up, he still showed poor weight gain and a short stature, with microcephaly. At the age of 14 months, he weighed 7.4 kg (less than 3rd percentile) and had a length of 75.9 cm (10th\u201325th percentile) and a 43.8 cm head circumference (less than 3rd percentile). PDA ligation was done at the age of 4 months. According to the parents, the patient had a delayed gross motor milestone from head control. The Bayley study performed at the age of 6 and 24 months showed a significant delay in both the motor and mental aspects, respectively. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that was done at the age of 5 months showed mild ventriculomegaly in the left lateral ventricle, and an arachnoid cyst ().\nWhen the patient was 5 years and 3 months old, he was admitted to the hospital due to afebrile generalized seizure. Before the admission, he had had recurrent febrile seizures since he was 12 months of age, with a frequency of 2 to 4 times per year, with a semiology of ocular deviation to the upward and generalized tonic-clonic type lasting for 30\u201360 seconds. During the patient's hospital stay, brain imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) were done (, ). The interictal EEG showed moderate abnormality with intermittent bifrontal sharp waves, which were sometimes generalized (). As the baby's mother refused antiepileptic drugs medication, the natural course was observed without medication. At that time, the patient still showed severe global developmental delay, remarkable hypotonia, a short stature, and dysmorphic features such as microcephaly; small, low-set ears; dark, straight eyebrows; deep-set eyes; flat nasal bridge; midface hypoplasia; and a small, pointed chin (). The previous diagnostic work-up done at other hospitals, including the conventional chromosomal analysis, revealed no definite causes. As such, array-CGH analysis was done. The patient was rebrought to the hospital for the recurrence of seizure. An antiepileptic drug (valproic acid) was started at age 5 years and 11 months. The array-CGH analysis showed 1p36 deletion syndrome with a 9.15-Mb copy loss of the 1p36.33-1p36.22 region (). The FISH analysis confirmed the diagnosis (). At age 6 years and 10 months, the patient's developmental milestone showed 12 months of gross motor development, a 15-month fine motor status, an 18-month personal-social age, 18 months of language development, and a 16-month cognitive-adaptive status. He is now on a 120 mg valproic-acid twice a day (15 mg/kg/day) and has been seizure-free for 17 months.",

        "LLM Answer": "23",
        "LLM Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\\nThe concentration of sodium is 140 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140 mEq sodium. The volume units are L, so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140 mmol sodium/L converts to 140 mEq sodium/L.\\nThe concentration of chloride is 90 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 90 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 90 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 90 mEq chloride. The volume units are L, so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 90 mmol chloride/L converts to 90 mEq chloride/L.\\nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 15 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 15 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 15 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 15 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units are L, so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 15 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 15 mEq bicarbonate/L.\\nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140 mEq/L - (90 mEq/L + 15 mEq/L) = 35 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's anion gap is 35 mEq/L.\\nPlugging in 35 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 35 - 12 = 23 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 23 mEq/L.",

        "Patient Note": "A 40-year-old, 167 cm, 93 kg pregnant woman gravida 3, para 2, with a 20-year history of KSS, was scheduled for an elective cesarean delivery at 39 weeks\u2019 gestation, because of a history of a complicated vaginal delivery with tearing of the anal sphincter 4 years ago, which was successfully repaired.\nHer KSS was manifested with external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and acquired left anterior hemiblock. Muscle biopsy demonstrated mitochondrial abnormalities. She presented with a high-grade Mobitz type II atrioventricular block (2:1) which required the establishment of a DAVID pacemaker/defibrillator (dual-chamber and VVI implantable defibrillator) 11 years earlier. She had undergone two normal vaginal deliveries.\nHer pregnancy had been complicated with a progressive proximal muscle weakness in her extremities and preeclampsia.\nOn physical examination, respiratory rate) was 17/min, heart rate (HR) 80/min, blood pressure (BP) 165/95 mm Hg, and pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2) 100% on room air. The patient's electrolytes, creatinine, and liver tests were normal. Hemoglobin concentration was 10.2 g/dL, and serum albumin level was 2.8 g/dL.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a pacemaker rhythm at HR of 80/min []. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitations and left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.61.\nIn preparation for cesarean delivery, multidisciplinary discussions involving her obstetrician, cardiologist, anesthesiologists, and the family of the patient were conducted, emphasizing the possibility of hemodynamic or the DAVID compromise during anesthesia. The obstetrician was instructed to limit the use of a monopolar electrocautery during the operation to short intermittent bursts at the lowest possible energy. Combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia was offered as the best option, and a written informed consent was obtained.\nAn external cardioverter/defibrillator unit with a pacing property to which she remained connected by external defibrillator pads, a magnet, and antiarrhythmic, vasopressor, and inotropic medications was on standby as rescue modality.\nThe patient was brought to the operating theater and volume loading with 500 ml of dextrose 5% in NaCl 0.9% solution was intravenously infused over 20 min, followed with an intravenous infusion of normal saline 0.9% at a rate of 5 mL/kg/h throughout the procedure. Monitoring was commenced with five-lead ECG with an active pacing mode [], noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry. No sedative premedication was given. Oxygen (2 L/min) was delivered through a nasal cannula. Normothermia was maintained using a warming mattress.\nCSE anesthesia was administered to the patient in a sitting position using a loss of resistance to saline technique at the L3\u2013L4 interspace using an 18-gauge Tuohy needle. Then, a 27-gauge, 127 mm pencil-point spinal needle was then passed through the epidural needle, and after confirming free flow of cerebrospinal fluid, hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 12.5 mg with fentanyl 25 \u03bcg was injected into the intrathecal space. Next, a 20-gauge epidural catheter was advanced 5.0 cm into the epidural space and secured. The patient was positioned with left lateral tilt with the electrocautery current return pad placed on her right thigh in an effort to minimize possible interference with the pacing function of the DAVID unit. A sensory level up to T4 dermatome, as tested by pinprick, was achieved bilaterally.\nSurgery commenced through a Pfannenstiel skin incision. Ten min after the induction of anesthesia, transient severe hypotension (BP was 67/33 mmHg that lasted for 10 min) was treated with administering a bolus of ephedrine (5 mg). A bolus of oxytocin 5 units was administered followed with an infusion of oxytocin 20 units in normal saline 500 mL immediately after delivery. A baby girl weighing 3210 g, with 1 and 5 min Apgar scores of 9 and 10, respectively, and a cord blood pH of 7.25, was born.\nIntraoperative vital signs remained stable throughout the surgery, with the exception of a noted decreased HR to 60/min near the end of surgery. No significant electromagnetic interference (EMI) was noted intraoperatively. Total estimated blood loss during surgery was 500 mL. The patient's intraoperative blood glucose, arterial blood gases, electrolytes, and serum lactate levels showed no abnormalities. No local anesthetics were administered through the epidural catheter during surgery.\nPostoperative analgesia was accomplished with a continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.125% and fentanyl 2 \u03bcg/mL through the epidural catheter, lornoxicam (8 mg/12 h), and paracetamol (1 g/6 h). Her DAVID unit was interrogated by the manufacturer in the postpartum period.

She did not consume alcohol, tobacco, or any drugs. The patient was examined at the age of 18 at a gynecology clinic for primary amenorrhea where, given the patient\u2019s active involvement in competitive track and field, she was diagnosed with athletic amenorrhea without further tests being conducted. Afterwards, the patient underwent no treatment and did not experience menstruation. Moreover, the patient had not engaged in sexual intercourse up to this point.\nUpon examination by a local physician with the main complaint of abdominal distention, the patient was referred to our hospital with a suspected ovarian tumor, as a giant 17 cm tumor was found in the pelvis. The inspection of the external genitalia revealed clitoral hypertrophy and narrowing of the vaginal opening (Fig. ). Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tumorous lesion in the pelvis measuring 218 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 178 mm, containing a mixture of cystic and solid components. The uterus could not be found. The cystic components contained blood, and the solid portion had a contrast effect (Fig. ). Examination by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed FDG accumulation in the tumor and in enlarged abdominal para-aortic lymph nodes. Blood tests revealed the following levels: white blood cells (WBC): 10.7/\u03bcL \u00d7 103; hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL; platelets: 412/\u03bcL \u00d7 104; C-reactive protein (CRP): 18.1 mg/dL; total protein: 7.7 g/dL; albumin: 3.8 g/dL; urea nitrogen: 8 mg/dL; creatinine: 0.53 mg/dL; total bilirubin: 0.6 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 30 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 8 IU/L; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): 52.4 mU/mL; luteinizing hormone (LH): 34.4 mU/mL; estradiol (E2): < 10 pg/mL; progesterone (P4): 0.66 ng/mL; and testosterone: 0.25 ng/mL. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (2.4 ng/mL) was within the normal range, but serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (5.86 ng/mL), lactate dehydrogenase (4574 \u00b5g/L), and CA125 (165 \u00b5g/mL) were elevated. Urinalysis was normal. As DSD was suspected because of the appearance of the pelvic tumor, chromosome testing was performed. The karyotype was found to exhibit 45,X/46,XY mosaicism, and the patient was diagnosed with MGD. Since the pelvic tumor was considered to be a gonadal tumor, a resulting complication of MGD, an exploratory laparotomy was performed in order to arrive at a definitive pathologic diagnosis of the tumor.\nA physical examination revealed a patient who looked unwell, with blood pressure of 119/77 mmHg, heart rate of 117 beats per minute, and body temperature of 38.7 \u00b0C. Neurological examination was unremarkable and did not offer any substantial information. Surgical findings revealed marked adhesions between the tumor and the surrounding organs, making excision difficult. Therefore, only a biopsy of the tumor was performed (Fig. a, b). The final pathological diagnosis was \u201cseminoma\u201d (Fig. ). Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with clinical stage IIB testicular cancer (seminoma) with MGD.\nPostoperative systemic chemotherapy was started promptly, consisting of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP). At the time of the fourth course of BEP, tumor markers had normalized (Fig. ). Marked tumor reduction was confirmed with imaging, and subsequently the patient underwent interval debulking surgery. Surgery involved bilateral gonadectomy and resection of disseminated peritoneal lesions (Figs. a, b, ). Pathological examination of the excised specimens was consistent with necrosis of the seminoma due to the effect of chemotherapy. No viable tumor remains were found. No further chemotherapy was administered, and the initial course of treatment was completed. We notified the patient regarding MGD, and she decided her future sex as female. Therefore, we proposed some surgical options for clitoromegaly or vaginal stenosis. However, she did not wish to pursue those at that time.\nCurrently, 4 years and 11 months after the initial treatment, there has been no recurrence of the tumor. In addition, the patient has been on postoperative hormone replacement therapy in the form of an estradiol/norethindrone acetate patch and psychotherapy continuously.",

Prior to the diagnosis of SCA, she was in good health and did not regularly take drugs. She denied smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol. At the time of the examination, she was taking benzodiazepines (triazolam 0.25 mg once daily) for anxious depressive syndrome, baclofen 25 mg three times a day for spasticity, and anti-cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) for pain treatment (etoricoxib 60 mg once daily). Preoperative blood tests, electrocardiogram, and thoracic X-ray were negative. On physical examination, it was possible to appreciate that she was tall, 168 cm, and weighed 63 kg. A cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. Her vital signs were normal with blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg and heart rate of 90 beats per minute. On neuropsychological examination, she presented a mild reduction in performance on the Rey\u2013Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, a limited ability to inhibit cognitive interference (Stroop Test), inability during the Multiple Features Targets Cancellation task, and a Spatial Span Score lower than normal; these were proofs of her dis-executive deficit. After discussing the case with a neurologist, general anesthesia was planned. In fact, our patient\u2019s anxiety and spasticity would have made regional anesthesia difficult to practice. Preoperatively, no medications were administered. General anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg intravenously and fentanyl 2 mcg/kg intravenously. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg intravenously. Anesthesia maintenance was performed with sevoflurane (in an oxygen/air mixture) and fentanyl. The minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane was set to achieve a Bi-spectral Index (BIS) value between 40 and 60. Mechanical ventilation was set with a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg, a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an inspiration/expiration rate of 1:2. These parameters remained stable during the surgical procedure. The respiration rate was adjusted to obtain an end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) between 38 and 45 mmHg. The surgery was uneventful with no significant blood loss and no transfusion was needed. The procedure lasted 2 hours. Upon awakening, she appeared calm and parameters were stable. In the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), she was warmed up and oxygen supplementation was administered. Thirty minutes after awakening, she developed an acute hyperactive delirium. She experienced episodes of confusion, logorrhea, and disorientation. She also exhibited reduced awareness of the environment and hallucinations with aggressive behavior. During this episode, her vital signs remained stable and her oxygen saturation was normal. An arterial blood test revealed no hypercapnia or hypoxia or electrolyte disorders. Haloperidol 5 mg was intravenously administered slowly over 5 minutes, but her behavior did not change. To avoid uncontrolled pain, a single shot fascia iliaca block was performed with 25 ml of ropivacaine 0.375% but she continued to have intermittent episodes of delirium. After 10 minutes, chlorpromazine 25 mg was infused intravenously. This drug seemed to have the same efficacy as haloperidol with a subsequent mild sedation. She was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) where chlorpromazine 25 mg was given again during the night for another crisis. She was discharged from ICU the next day under normal neurological conditions.\nAfter 1 month, she was readmitted for the development of an acute periprosthetic hip infection sustained by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus without signs of systemic sepsis. On examination, her temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, blood pressure was 128/95 mmHg, and heart rate was 75 beats per minute. Only the wound swab was positive for infection; hemocultures and urine cultures were negative. Preoperative blood tests showed: hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL; platelets 233 \u00d7 109/L; neutrophils 4.26 \u00d7 10 9/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 47 mm/hour, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 27.2 mg/L. Renal and hepatic function indices were within normal limits. Debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) was performed under general anesthesia with the same modalities []. During surgery and after taking new periprosthetic tissue for microbiological examination, teicoplanin was administered intravenously at a loading dose of 400 mg. For the second time, our patient developed POD treated with chlorpromazine 25 mg intravenously with immediate sedation. Within 24 hours, the delirium resolved with no consequences. During the following days, 200 mg of teicoplanin was administered daily and 1 gr of cefazolin every 12 hours intravenously until discharge.\nOne month after discharge, she returned for follow-up. She was taking her habitual medications and, at the time of the examination, she exhibited no evidence of new disorders or joint infection. She looked well and denied any symptoms of confusion, disorientation, or hallucinations. The hip infection healed without any complication. She was re-evaluated at 3 and 6 months after surgery. Her ESR, CRP, and other biochemical values were within normal limits and her neurological status was stable.",

The patient did not report any pain, discomfort or medical problems; however, the patient's response was late during the history taking. The patient had a history of successful repair of cleft lip and palate. Upon extra-oral examination, the frontal view showed facial asymmetry on the left side and flattening of the nasal bridge, increased intercanthal distance (35 centimeters) (orbital hypertelorism) and frontal bossing (54 centimeters), multiple skin lesions on her arms, and right foot and palmar/ plantar pits (Figures , , ).\nThe intra-oral examination revealed multiple carious teeth, painless hard swelling in the left side of the mandible, and mild pain on percussion in all the left mandibular posterior teeth. An orthopantomogram (OPG) showed bilateral radiolucent lesions associated with a partially erupted mandibular second molar teeth. The left mandibular lesion was extended up to the ramus of the mandible; moreover, the patient had a horizontally impacted maxillary right second molar and congenitally missing second premolars and third molars (Figure ).\nCone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was requested for detailed radiological assessment of the mandibular lesions. Accidentally, CBCT revealed another large lesion associated with the impacted right maxillary second molar, which extended up to the right maxillary sinus. In addition, the lower left lesion was severely expanded in all directions (buccolingual, anteroposterior, and superoinferior), and perforations were noticed in the buccal and lingual borders of the mandible (Figure ). A skull X-ray revealed calcification of the falx cerebra on the posteroanterior and lateral views.\nIn addition, the anteroposterior view of a chest X-ray showed a bifid fifth rib on the left side (Figure ).\nA diagnosis of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome was made. Both maxillary and mandibular right cystic lesions of the jaws were enucleated surgically. Marsupialization was done for the mandibular left lesion and a biopsy was performed. The histopathological examination of the tissues showed KCOT of the right and left mandibular lesions and a dentigerous cyst of the maxillary right-side lesion. The patient was followed up every week after the surgery in the first month. The patient will then be followed-up once each month for six months. The tube will be removed after six months and then the patient will be followed up every six months.\nAfter two months of follow-up, the marsupialized cyst showed improvement and bone deposition (Figure ).

        "Question": "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?",
        "LLM Answer": "2.0",
        "LLM Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap. The formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L)). The concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. The concentration of chloride is 100.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 100.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 100.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 100.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 100.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 100.0 mEq chloride/L. The concentration of bicarbonate is 23.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 23.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 23.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 23.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 23.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 23.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. Plugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (100.0 mEq/L + 23.0 mEq/L) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L. Plugging in 14.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 14.0 - 12 = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 2.0 mEq/L.",

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mEq. To convert from 144.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 144.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 144.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 144.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed.

        "Patient Note": "A 51-year-old man (height 168 cm, weight 79 kg) presented with right vestibular schwannoma and an underlying bronchiectasis of the right lung. He had presented with the symptoms of progressive loss of hearing and imbalance while walking.\nHe gave a history of a cough with expectoration and recurrent lung infections since childhood and was evaluated for tuberculosis and found to be negative. During this admission, he had a cough but he could not bring out the sputum. Since there were no signs of active lung infection, we did not perform a bronchoscopy to evaluate cause for bronchiectasis. He is a hypertensive for 20 years on treatment with amlodipine 5 mg once daily. On examination, he had extensive crepitation over the right hemithorax, and tracheal shift to the right. His magnetic resonance imaging brain (T2-weighted image), showed a large vestibular schwannoma (5.2 cm \u00d7 4.3 cm \u00d7 3.5 cm in size) with obstructive hydrocephalus []. His chest X-ray findings showed right-sided bronchiectasis and fibrosis with the gross mediastinal shift []. Spirometry revealed a moderate obstructive pulmonary disease. Preoperative arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) on room air showed compensated respiratory acidosis with the pH of 7.43, PaO2 of 74 mmHg and partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 48 mmHg with HCO3 of 31 mmHg. An echocardiogram revealed left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with normal LV systolic function, and there was no pulmonary hypertension.\nIn view of severe bronchiectasis and long duration surgery in the left lateral position (diseased side of the lung being up), decided to isolate the right lung using right-sided double lumen tube (RDLT). In this case, we chose to put a RDLT because of the following reasons.\nThe angle between bronchus and trachea was obliterated because of lung fibrosis with the mediastinal shift. Right bronchus was almost in a straight line with the trachea []. Hence, placement of RDLT will be easy when compared to the left. With a left DLT, secretion from the right lung can get accumulated above the left bronchial cuff. The presence of low pressure cuff cannot provide a tight seal against spillage. Hence, we felt that presence of RDLT will give better protection than the left DLT.\nIn the operating theater, standard monitors including electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, and noninvasive blood pressure were connected. His room air saturation was 94%. Modified rapid sequence induction was done using 2 \u03bcg/kg of fentanyl and 2 mg/kg of propofol, and was then paralyzed with 1.0 mg/kg of rocuronium and intubated with 39F RDLT. Mallinckdrodt\u2122 the tube position was confirmed by fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FOB). Both the lungs were suctioned separately before placing the patient in the left lateral position. After positioning, the head was fixed using Mayfield head clamp, repeat FOB was done to confirm the lung isolation. Copious thick purulent secretion was suctioned out from the right lung. To assess the contribution of the right lung on CO2 elimination split lung ventilation was performed by ventilating only diseased lung (right side). There was a significant ETCO2 value noted (20 mmHg) while ventilating the right lung, we have decided ventilate both lungs. The patient was ventilated with pressure controlled ventilation using lung protective ventilation strategies. The end-tidal CO2 was maintained between 35 and 37 mm of Hg.\nIntraoperatively, anesthesia was maintained using air, oxygen (FiO20.6) and isoflurane, and vecuronium infusion. Intermittent bolus doses of fentanyl and intravenous paracetamol were given for analgesia. Serial ABG's were taken to ensure the adequacy of ventilation. PaCO2 was maintained between 40 and 45 mmHg (baseline value was 49 mmHg). Vitals were stable throughout the surgery. Brain relaxation was reported adequate during the surgery.\nThe surgery lasted for 6 h. At the end of surgery, bilateral endobronchial suctioning was done in the lateral position. An intravenous lignocaine (1.5 mg/kg) was given to prevent coughing before placing the patient in supine oblique (left side up). Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg). The trachea was extubated when the patient was fully awake. The patient was shifted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in the right lateral position. His postoperative chest X-ray showed clear lung field on the left side []. He was monitored in NICU for 2 days and shifted to ward. Later, he was discharged from the hospital in a good clinical state.",

        "Patient Note": "A 25-year-old male with a family background of Alport disease was referred for an assessment of kidney involvement. Family history consisted of a mother-related uncle on dialysis with biopsy-proven Alport disease, another mother-related cousin with kidney involvement, and a grandfather who died due to sudden death at the age of 42. The patient was asymptomatic and normotensive (blood pressure 115/68 mmHg), with a body mass index of 24 and no tobacco consumption. Main laboratory results included hematocrit 44%, glycemia 78 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.07 mg/dL, creatinine clearance of 74 mL/min, sodium 143 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mEq/L, serum albumin 4.3 g/dL, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion 250 mg/day. A renal ultrasound was normal.\nPodocyturia was assessed as follows: fresh urine samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm during 5 min and the supernatant was discarded; 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2\u20137.4 was added to the sediment to cover it. Smears were made from each sample on 2% silane-coated slides. The slides were stained with immunofluorescence technique and observed by epifluorescent microscopy. The slides were preincubated with no immune rabbit serum in phosphate-buffered saline 0.1 M, pH 7.4 (PBS, 1 : 100) at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with a polyclonal anti-synaptopodin antibody (1 : 100, ab109560 Alexa Fluor\u00ae, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) overnight in a wet chamber at 4\u00b0C. After several rinses in PBS, the slides were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1 : 200 Alexa Fluor 488, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) for 2 hours at room temperature in a wet chamber. Finally, all the slides were mounted using Fluoroshield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and observed in an epifluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse E200, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Negative controls were performed without primary antibodies. Podocyte counting was assessed by counting in urinary smears the number of cells in 10 microscopy fields of \u00d720. The podocyte count was 1.07 cells per \u00d720 field; the number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 29.9, and the number of podocytes/100 mL of urine was 5.35 (). This result was compared with 5 controls (): 3 males and 2 females; mean age 22 \u00b1 7.2 years with no past history of morbidities; creatinine clearance 108 mL/min; mean 24-hour urinary albumin excretion 88 \u00b1 11 mg/day. The mean podocyte count was 0.12 \u00b1 0.1 cells per \u00d720 field while the mean number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 10.7 and the mean number of podocytes/100 mL of urine was 1.1. The patient declined to undergo a kidney biopsy but accepted to receive amiloride 5 mg/day orally. After three months of therapy new podocyturia and laboratory results were obtained. The podocyte count was 0.2 cells per \u00d720 field; the number of podocytes per gram of urinary creatinine was 9, and the number of podocytes/100 mL of urine was 1 (). Blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg, serum creatinine 1.09 mg/dL, creatinine clearance 79 mL/min, sodium 143 mEq/L, potassium 3.9 mEq/L, and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion 19 mg/day.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?",
        "LLM Answer": "143",
        "LLM Explanation": "To correct the sodium concentration for hyperglycemia, we can use the formula: Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100). However, in this case, the patient's glycemia (serum glucose level) is 78 mg/dL, which is below 100 mg/dL. Therefore, there is no need to correct for hyperglycemia since the correction is meant for elevated blood glucose levels that might result in pseudohyponatremia. Given this, the measured sodium concentration of 143 mEq/L already reflects the correct sodium level with a normal glucose level.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "142.472",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.\nThe concentration of sodium is 143.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 78.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 143.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (78.0 - 100) = 142.472 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 142.472 mEq/L.",

        "Patient Note": "A 58-year-old male with no prior medical problems, who was leading an active lifestyle, presented to our emergency department with progressively worsening shortness of breath and abdominal distension for one month. His breathlessness had gradually worsened to the point where he felt winded even upon getting out of bed. He also reported intermittent abdominal discomfort associated with a decrease in appetite for a similar duration. Initially, the patient sought medical attention from his primary care physician and was started on treatment for community-acquired pneumonia without any significant improvement. He denied any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. Review of systems was unremarkable including bowel habits, which were regular.\nThe patient had been a nonsmoker his entire life but had secondhand exposure to smoking from his wife. His alcohol consumption was limited only to social occasions and he denied any illicit drug use. He had no known allergies, nor did he take any daily medications. Family history was not significant for any malignancies. No recent travel was reported and by occupation, he was a tailor.\nOn examination, the patient was found lying comfortably in bed. Vital signs were significant for a pulse rate of 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. He was normotensive and afebrile. No cyanosis, clubbing, rash, or lymphadenopathy was noted. Respiratory examination revealed decreased air entry and dullness on percussion on the right side of the chest. His abdomen was distended, non-tender with a palpable liver and spleen, and he was noted to have shifting dullness. The rest of the examination was within normal limits. Laboratory data are summarized in Table .\nUpon admission, a chest x-ray showed a near-complete opacity of the right hemithorax secondary to a large pleural effusion (Figure ). A bedside thoracocentesis was performed and 600 milliliters of whitish milky pleural fluid was drained (Table ). The pleural fluid analysis was consistent with chylothorax. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed a large soft tissue mass in the region of the pancreatic head with extensive diffuse lymphadenopathy and minimal perihepatic ascites (Figure ). Further review of imaging revealed soft tissue deposits in the anterior abdomen and pelvis with peritoneal enhancement concerning for peritoneal carcinomatosis. The initial impression was pancreatic adenocarcinoma with peritoneal seeding. An oncology consultation was requested and a biopsy of the peritoneum was advised due to ease of access. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of the peritoneal lesion with analysis of the peritoneal fluid (Table ) and a CT-guided placement of a right chest pleural drainage catheter was performed by interventional radiology. Analysis of the peritoneal pathology specimen revealed a mature B-cell neoplasm reported as a grade 2 follicular lymphoma (Figure ), and immunophenotype stains revealed CD20+, CD79A+, CD10+, BCL-2+, BCL-6+, CD5-, CYCLIN D1-, CD3-, CD43-, AE1/AE3-. Cytology from the previously obtained pleural fluid also demonstrated lymphomatous infiltration. Due to persistent right pleural effusion, embolization of the thoracic duct was attempted without success. The patient was eventually transferred to a tertiary center under thoracic surgery service for further management of the high output chylothorax. He eventually was enrolled in the lymphoma program of the tertiary care center and started on chemotherapy.",

Her total leucocyte count (TLC) was 12,400/mm3, blood urea was 69 mg/dl, serum creatinine was 3.7 mg/dl, and potassium was 5.1 meq/l. Liver function tests were within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasound showed moderate hydronephrosis of the right kidney and increased parenchymal echogenicity with diminished corticomedullary differentiation of the left kidney. Computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen showed right kidney hydroureteronephrosis with DJ stent in situ, and the left kidney showed parenchymal atrophy with irregular margins. The patient was diagnosed as a case of acute chronic kidney disease with DJ stent blockage. The DJ stent was changed, and the pus was evacuated. Gram stain examination of the pus showed plenty of branching Gram-positive bacilli, along with Gram-negative bacilli (Figure ).\nThe specimen was processed similarly to Case 1. Escherichia coli was grown in aerobic culture, and Bifidobacterium sp. was cultured in anaerobic culture. The identification of Bifidobacterium sp. was done by both MALDI-TOF Vitek\u00ae MS and Vitek\u00ae 2.

He reported fatigue and exertional dyspnea, and presented persistent AF on EKG. He had a weight of 68 kg, and a height of 170 cm (BMI = 23 kg/m2), with high estimated thromboembolic risk (CHA2DS2VASc = 4). He was previously prescribed with anticoagulation (Dabigatran 110 mg bid), beta-blocker (bisoprolol 5 mg od), ACE-inhibitor (ramipril 5 mg od), diuretic (furosemide 50 mg) therapy. A 2D-echocardiogram documented left ventricle dilation (LVEDD (end diastolic diameter): 61 mm) with systolic dysfunction (EF (ejection fraction): 38%). A 2D-transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed absence of images referable to atrial and auricular thrombosis. Single-lobe left appendage displayed reduced function with velocity peaks of 25 cm/sec. The left atrial area was 28 cm2. No relevant atherosclerotic plaques were found in the thoracic aorta. Written informed consent was obtained and the patient underwent radiofrequency electrical pulmonary veins isolation plus roof and mitral isthmus ablation lines during systemic intraprocedural heparinization (activation clotting time (ACT)-target: 300\u2013350 s). Electrical cardioversion was also performed due to presence of persistent AF. The total procedural time was 180 min. Dabigatran was temporarily interrupted for 36 h across the procedure and the patient was discharged the next day. After one week he was admitted to the emergency department for sudden dyspnea, being hospitalized for acute heart failure. At admission the EKG showed sinus tachycardia, while chest X-ray depicted bilateral alveolar edema. During hospitalization, after achieving hemodynamic stabilization, the patient suffered aphasia and space-time disorientation with near loss of consciousness. The Angio-CT (computational tomography) showed hypodense lesions in the left cortico-subcortical temporo-occipital area and in the left cerebellar hemisphere as showed in . Carotid and vertebral arteries were free from hemodynamic atherosclerotic plaques. Symptoms completely disappeared after two days and at the 24 h CT scan control, the lesions were stable, in the absence of hemorrhagic transformation. After a few days, the patient complained left limb pain and an acute distal embolism was diagnosed. A new transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a further deterioration of left ventricular ejection fraction (EF: 30%) with no evidence of intraventricular thrombosis and a clearly discernable interatrial septal defect with left-to-right shunt, this was likely attributable to the trans-septal puncture performed during the ablation (). Ultrasonography of the groin region documented in situ not compressible left femoral vein thrombosis (). Non fractioned heparin infusion was administered with complete resolution of both the arterial embolic occlusion and venous thrombosis. After a few days, oral anticoagulation with apixaban was initiated and the patient was discharged. At the six months follow-up, he presented with mild cognitive impairment, which persisted overtime till the last visit.",

In addition, immunofluorescence (IF) disclosed no immunoglobulin and complement deposition. He was pathologically diagnosed with MCD, for which he received various immunosuppressive drugs including steroid pulse therapy, mizoribine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil for FRNS. However it had been difficult to maintain long-term remission. Twenty-one times of recurrences had occurred before having a tonsillectomy, and more than half of them were triggered by tonsillitis. He was diagnosed by an otolaryngologist with chronic tonsillitis, as he had four or more episodes of acute tonsillitis a year, and bilateral palatine tonsillectomy was performed for chronic tonsillitis to reduce the recurrence of tonsillitis. Informed consent for the operation was obtained from the patient. On admission, his height was 161.5 cm, body weight was 60.6 kg and blood pressure was 118/64 mmHg. No abnormality was observed on general physical examination. Urinalysis showed urine specific gravity of 1.021 and pH of 7.5. By urinary qualitative, urine protein and occult blood were negative.

Her height was 153 cm and her body weight was 58 kg. She had a history of hypertension. The clinical course of her joint pain was as follows: she initially complained of continued right hip joint pain at the age of 83 years and 3 months. Therefore, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration and bisphosphonate (BP) treatment for osteoporosis were given. A mild thoracic vertebral compression fracture was also observed approximately 7 years earlier at the patient\u2019s first visit. Osteoporotic treatment with BP had been continued since that time. Right hip bone mineral density (BMD) 7 years prior and at present were 0.915 (T score = -1.7) and 1.094 (T score = -0.1), respectively. Left hip BMD had risen from 0.702 (T score = -1.9) 7 years earlier to 0.755 (T score = -1.5) at present. During follow-up, she sometimes complained of mild hip joint pain. At the time of this report, her joint pain was substantially decreased.\nRight hip range of motion (ROM) was slightly restricted at the patient\u2019s first visit, but did not worsen over 7 years.\nA right hip plain radiograph at age 83 showed joint space narrowing (Kellgren-Lawrence [KL] grading II) [] (Fig. ) that was diagnosed as radiographic OA. There was no acetabular dysplasia. At the age of 83 years and 8 months, plain radiographs revealed greater joint space narrowing, a band around the bone defect change-like osteonecrosis, and a concave shape to the right femoral head (Fig. ). The necrotic region of the femoral head had progressed a year after onset and was noticeably worsened at the age of 86 (Fig. , ). Ensuing radiographs showed progressive destruction of the femoral head and osteosclerotic change of the remaining joint line (Fig. ). In addition, radiographs retrospectively uncovered a laddering-shaped deformity in the right lateral proximal femoral head and a fracture-like line that were consistent with the necrotic region (Fig. , arrow).\nThe particularity of this case was that 1) the patient was initially diagnosed as having radiographic OA, 2) joint pain was markedly improved after a few months, 3) the femoral head degenerated over several years in the absence of joint pain, and 4) radiographic diagnosis changed based on the timing of disease progression.\nThe patient was informed that the data from her case would be submitted for publication and gave her consent.",

        "Patient Note": "C. K., a 53-year-old Caucasian female, was referred by her primary care physician for abnormal liver function tests. She was first diagnosed with HCV exposure in 2005 with genotype 3a and had undergone pegylated interferon monotherapy weekly for six months. She achieved end of treatment response. Subsequently, she continued to use intravenous drugs. On presentation to our clinic on 05/04/2011, patient was found to have reinfection with genotype 1a with an HCV viral load of 29,000 IU/mL. She had no nausea, vomiting, heartburn, abdominal pain, or dysphagia. She had lost some weight but she was dieting. She denied any intravenous drug and alcohol use in last 3 years.\nHer past medical history was notable for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis, vertebral osteomyelitis, hyperlipidemia, diverticulosis, and Helicobacter pylori gastritis. There was no family history of celiac disease, type 1 diabetes or any other autoimmune diseases. She is a former smoker. Her medications included butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine, simvastatin, and esomeprazole.\nInitial physical examination showed temperature of 98.2\u00b0F, pulse of 72 beats/minute, BP of 116/70 mm/Hg, and weight of 146 pounds. Physical examination was normal \u201cwithout stigmata of liver disease or malnutrition and so forth.\u201d\nLaboratory data on initial visit showed normal complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic profile (CMP), and iron studies. Pt was found to have HCV viral load of 4,515,392 IU/ml and genotype 1a. Other causes of liver disease including hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, and HIV were ruled out. The patient underwent a liver biopsy which showed Metavir grade 2 inflammatory activity and stage 1 fibrosis ().\nColonoscopy was also done on 6/25/2008 at different facility, which did not show any polyps but showed diverticular disease of descending colon and sigmoid colon. The patient underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) done on 10/7/2009 which was unremarkable.\nTreatment was initiated on dual therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2a at 180 \u03bcg subcutaneous weekly plus ribavirin 600 mg orally twice per day for a 4-week lead-in phase, followed by triple therapy using boceprevir (BOC) 800 mg orally three times per day for total of 28 weeks. HCV viral loads which were collected at weeks 4, 8, 12, 21, and 24 were undetectable by polymerase chain reaction. During treatment, the patient developed neutropenia and anemia, which were treated with pegfilgrastim and darbepoetin alfa.\nApproximately 4 weeks after initiation of triple therapy the patient developed loose nonbloody bowel movements, which was not reported at the time. She experienced nausea and decreased appetite but no vomiting or abdominal pain. Occasionally she felt bloated. There was no fever, chills, or skin rash.\nThree months following cessation of treatment the patient complained of ongoing weakness and dyspnea on exertion which had begun after the initiation of therapy but which had not resolved completely. She had ten-pound weight loss during treatment which persisted, but she also now admitted to having 5-6 watery loose bowel movements for the preceding five months. Repeat CBC showed low hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL (baseline 14 g/dL). The patient failed to give stool samples for analysis. She underwent an EGD and colonoscopy. During EGD, mucosa in the stomach and second and third part of duodenum appeared normal but biopsies from second portion of the duodenum revealed mild villous blunting, mild crypt hyperplasia, and minimal intraepithelial lymphocytes consistent with CD (). The tissue transglutaminase IgA was 85 U/mL. The patient was started on gluten-free diet. Her intestinal symptoms improved and the hemoglobin returned to normal.",

        "Patient Note": "The patient was a 49-year-old man with chronic renal insufficiency. He underwent right renal transplantation in the Chinese People's Armed Police Force General Hospital in November 2016. Following transplantation, the patient underwent immunosuppression therapy, which included tacrolimus, prednisone, and myfortic, resulting in the return of normal renal function in the patient.\nTwo years later, the level of sCr in the patient gradually increased from normal to 274 mmol/L during routine laboratory testing. Enhanced MRI demonstrated multiple, variably sized quasi-circular lesions with slightly short signal intensity on T1WI, slightly long signal intensity on T2WI, and high signal intensity on DWI. The larger size lesion was about 4.66 cm by 3.10 cm (Fig. ). PET-CT revealed a soft tissue mass in the pelvis of the transplanted kidney (with an elevated SUV of 2.6), and multiple metastatic hypermetabolic soft tissue density nodules can be observed in the parenchyma of the transplanted kidney (with a maximum SUV of 2.9). No metastatic hypermetabolic lesions were observed in any other parts of the body.\nA puncture biopsy of the transplanted kidney was performed, and the results indicated large neoplastic cells. The immunohistochemistry examination revealed the following: CD34 (few +), CD68 (KP1) (few +), CD163 (-), lysozyme (few +), MPO (+), Ki-67 (>70% +), CD3 (few +), CD20 (-), TdT (few +), CD15 (-), CD117 (+), FISH: EBER(-). Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of leukemic infiltration (Fig. ), with normal chromosomes (46, XY). Examinations of fusion genes for both acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myeloid leukemia were negative. NGS examinations of the transplanted kidney was performed on 34 commonly mutated genes in AML (listed in ) and showed mutations of KRAS (NM_004985:exon2:c.G35A:p.G12Drs121913529), DNMT3A (NM_022552:exon15:c.1675delT:p.C559fs) , and no gene mutations in the bone marrow. Eventually, the patient was diagnosed with de novo MS in the transplanted kidney. Detailed information on the donor was not available, but the other transplant recipient did not have any problems in the transplanted kidney.\nThe patient underwent systemic chemotherapy in our hospital in October 2019, and received DA regimen chemotherapy (daunorubicin 100 mg on days 1-3 and cytarabine 170 mg on days 1-7). The patient responded well to the treatment, and the size of the mass in the transplanted kidney decreased and the level of sCr decreased to 192 mmol/L. The patient underwent a second cycle of DA regimen chemotherapy 30 days later. The size of the biggest lesion decreased to 2.5cm by 1.8cm, but the level of sCr remained at around 180 mmol/L. Therefore, we changed the chemotherapy regimen to cytarabine 2.5 g every 12h on days 1, 3, and 5, and etoposide 100 mg on days 1-3 for 3 cycles. However, 3 days after the 5th cycle of the revised chemotherapy regimen, the patient presented with progressive generalized motor weakness and slurred speech, without headache and vomiting, and the patient couldn\u2019t stand and walk without assistance. A routine blood test showed WBC 4\u00d7109/L, NEUT 3.84\u00d7109/L, HGB 94.3 g/L, and PLT 44\u00d7109/L. The patient\u2019s liver function, serum ions, and other metabolic panels were within normal limits, except that the level of sCr was 157 mmol/L. Head CT and MRI did not show any new abnormal acute findings, and it was presumed that the neurologic symptoms experienced by the patient were a result of cytarabine neurotoxicity. Thereafter the patient was treated with prednisone 40 mg twice a day for 3 days, which led to a significant improvement in his symptoms. After recovering from the neurologic symptoms, the patient refused to continue chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patient was followed up on April 20, 2021 and he could speak fluently, but sometimes walked with an unsteady step. The size of the biggest lesion in the transplanted kidney decreased to 1.7 cm and the level of sCr was maintained at around 200mol/L.",
        "Question": "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2?",
        "LLM Answer": "33.2",
        "LLM Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coefficient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coefficient is 1.0. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\\nThe patient is 49 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is provided as 200 mmol/L. To convert this to mg/dL, we use the conversion factor: 1 mg/dL = 88.4 mmol/L. Thus, 200 mmol/L is approximately equal to 200/88.4 = 2.26 mg/dL.\\nBecause the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.\\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (2.26/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**49 * 1.0 = 33.24.\\nHence, the GFR value is 33.2 ml/min/1.73 m\\u00b2.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "0.009",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 49 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 200.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from mmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 200.0 mmol. To convert 200.0 mmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 200.0 mmol Serum Creatinine * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.2 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.2 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 22.624 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 22.624 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 22.624 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 22624.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 22624.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 2262.4 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 200.0 mmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 2262.4 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (2262.4/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**49 * 1.0 = 0.009.\nHence, the GFR value is 0.009 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2.",

        "Patient Note": "A 90-year-old woman presented at our institution suffering from right hip joint pain that had been absent since an earlier visit when she was 83 years old. Her height was 153 cm and her body weight was 58 kg. She had a history of hypertension. The clinical course of her joint pain was as follows: she initially complained of continued right hip joint pain at the age of 83 years and 3 months. Therefore, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration and bisphosphonate (BP) treatment for osteoporosis were given. A mild thoracic vertebral compression fracture was also observed approximately 7 years earlier at the patient\u2019s first visit. Osteoporotic treatment with BP had been continued since that time. Right hip bone mineral density (BMD) 7 years prior and at present were 0.915 (T score = -1.7) and 1.094 (T score = -0.1), respectively. Left hip BMD had risen from 0.702 (T score = -1.9) 7 years earlier to 0.755 (T score = -1.5) at present. During follow-up, she sometimes complained of mild hip joint pain. At the time of this report, her joint pain was substantially decreased.\nRight hip range of motion (ROM) was slightly restricted at the patient\u2019s first visit, but did not worsen over 7 years.\nA right hip plain radiograph at age 83 showed joint space narrowing (Kellgren-Lawrence [KL] grading II) [] (Fig. ) that was diagnosed as radiographic OA. There was no acetabular dysplasia. At the age of 83 years and 8 months, plain radiographs revealed greater joint space narrowing, a band around the bone defect change-like osteonecrosis, and a concave shape to the right femoral head (Fig. ). The necrotic region of the femoral head had progressed a year after onset and was noticeably worsened at the age of 86 (Fig. , ). Ensuing radiographs showed progressive destruction of the femoral head and osteosclerotic change of the remaining joint line (Fig. ). In addition, radiographs retrospectively uncovered a laddering-shaped deformity in the right lateral proximal femoral head and a fracture-like line that were consistent with the necrotic region (Fig. , arrow).\nThe particularity of this case was that 1) the patient was initially diagnosed as having radiographic OA, 2) joint pain was markedly improved after a few months, 3) the femoral head degenerated over several years in the absence of joint pain, and 4) radiographic diagnosis changed based on the timing of disease progression.\nThe patient was informed that the data from her case would be submitted for publication and gave her consent.",

        "Patient Note": "A 72-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for surgery for esophageal cancer. At admission, her blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg and pulse rate was 76 beats per minute. She was 152 cm in height and weighted 62 Kg. Physical examination was unremarkable. Preoperatively, renal function was moderately decreased (creatinine, 0.95 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen: 16.5 mg/dL, uric acid: 5.7 mg/dL, sodium: 144 mEq/L, potassium: 4.1 mEq/L, chloride 110 mEq/L, phosphorus 3.7 mg/dL). During the thoracoscopic esophagectomy, blood loss was 460 ml, and hemodynamics were stable.\nPostoperatively, approximately 2 L of hypotonic fluid (0.2% saline with 4.3% dextrose) daily were administered, urine volume was stable (1.1\u20131.8 L), and plasma sodium levels were unchanged (140 mEq/L). However, on the third postoperative day, she suddenly developed polyuria (3.8 L/day) together with a decrease in CVP (). Serum sodium levels dropped to 124 mEq/L on the next day. Despite volume-to-volume correction with isotonic saline, the serum sodium levels dropped to a nadir of 112 mEq/L together with hyperkalemia (5.6 mEq/L) on the fifth postoperative day, and her consciousness level deteriorated. When her urine volume was 3.8 L and 3.5 L, there was a negative water balance (without including perspiration); \u22120.9 L and \u22120.5 L, respectively. The hematocrit value increased from 27.4% to 33.7% during the 2 days without blood transfusion. The next day, our department was consulted for further evaluation. She appeared dehydrated and there was an additional decrease in her CVP to a nadir of 1 cm of H2O. Laboratory findings on consultation are shown in . Urinary sodium concentrations were markedly high and serum uric acid levels were decreased from 5.7 mg/dL to 1.4 mg/dL. Urinary N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosamininase (NAG) and \u03b22-microglobulin were high and the calculated maximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) was relatively low (2.4 mg/dL), suggesting proximal tubule dysfunction. Furthermore, the calculated transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) value was low (3.6) for her serum potassium levels (4.7 mEq/L), suggesting that aldosterone action at cortical collecting duct (CCD) was impaired. These features were not consistency with the diagnosis of a SIADH. Thus, she was diagnosed as having SLN due to renal tubular dysfunction. Sodium correction was done with 3% saline and fludrocortisone was started at a dose of 0.05 mg/day. Thereafter, urinary volume decreased and there was a gradual increase in serum sodium levels to 138 mEq/L and serum uric acid levels to 3.4 mg/dL. Her consciousness level completely recovered. On the 20th postoperative day fludrocortisone was discontinued and she was discharged. She has been followed as an outpatient without recurrence of the hyponatremia.",

The Total Body Water is approximately 50% of body weight in elderly women. The patient's weight is 62 kg, and the ideal sodium concentration is 140 mEq/L. The patient's actual sodium concentration at its nadir was 112 mEq/L.\\nFirst, calculate the TBW: TBW = 0.50 \u00d7 62 kg = 31 L.\\nUse the formula to calculate the free water deficit: Free Water Deficit = 31 L \u00d7 ((140 / 112) - 1) = 31 L \u00d7 0.25 = 7.75 L.\\nTherefore, the patient's free water deficit is approximately 7.75 liters.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "0.797",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the free water deficit is (total body water percentage) * (weight) * (sodium/140 - 1), where the total body water percentage is a percentage expressed as a decimal, weight is in kg, and the sodium concentration is in mmol/L.\nThe patient's total body weight percentage is based on the patient's age and gender.\nThe patient is 72 years old. The patient's is a Female.\nThe patient's age is greater than 64 years and so the patient is considered elderly. For elderly female's, the total body water percentage value is 0.45.\nThe patient's weight is 62.0 kg. The concentration of sodium is 144.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 144.0 mEq. To convert from 144.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 144.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 144.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 144.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 144.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 144.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.45 * 62.0 * (144.0/140 - 1) = 0.797 L.

        "Patient Note": "An 8-year-old Bangladeshi boy presented to our out patient department (OPD) with complaints of gaining weight for the last 9 months. The parents were also concerned that the boy was not attaining the height according to his age. The child was born to nonconsanguineous parents at term, by normal vaginal delivery. Birth weight was 2.6 kg. Physical examination revealed a chubby boy with moon face and protruding abdomen (). Increased body hair, striae, and other stigmata of MAS such as caf\u00e9-au-lait spots were absent. An unexpected finding was an abnormally large phallus with coarse pubic hair (). On enquiry, the parents gave no history of steroid intake. His IQ scores were appropriate for his age and there was no history of voice change, and his sibling was in good health. The patient's body length was 92 cm (<3rd percentile; standard deviation score (SDS) \u22126.5) and his weight was 29 kg (80th percentile; SDS +1.6).\nBlood pressure was 220/140 mmHg. Biochemical evaluation revealed a cortisol level of 25.80 \u03bcg/dL with a concurrent plasma ACTH level of 10.0 pg/mL (within normal limits). His serum cortisol following high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST) (0.25 mg of dexamethasone every 6 hours for 48 hours (20 \u03bcg/kg/dose)) was 20.38 \u03bcg/dL and fasting blood sugar was 110 mg/dL ().\nUltrasonography revealed a left suprarenal mass with parenchymal disease of kidneys. Patient underwent a contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CECT) scan which divulged a large, well-circumscribed mildly enhancing adrenal mass (8 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 cm approx.) having few internal calcifications at left suprarenal region, which had displaced left kidney slightly downwards (Figures and ).\nThe patient underwent left adrenal adrenalectomy following laparotomy, which revealed a 8.2 \u00d7 6.3 \u00d7 5.2 cm lobulated mass with capsule being intact and weighing 130 gm. There were no adhesions to adjacent organs, no lymphadenopathy, and the inferior vena was spared. Histopathological evaluation revealed a benign cortical neoplastic lesion, suggestive of adrenal adenoma, composed of large polygonal cells with centrally placed nuclei and abundant pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. Some of the cells showed endocrine atypia albeit capsular and vascular invasion being absent.\nIn the postoperative management, the patient was given hydrocortisone (I/M) which was tapered off slowly. After one week, cortisol levels were within normal limits demonstrating biochemical remission of Cushing's syndrome. There was also moderate decline in the weight of the patient. The patient was discharge on post-operative day 10. Followup was done after three months and patient had lost more weight and adrenal imaging was normal.",

        "Patient Note": "A 20-year-old man (height, 177 cm; weight, 60 kg) was hospitalized for an orthognathic surgery. He was diagnosed with bilateral CLP and mandibular prognathism associated with midface deficiency, and was scheduled to undergo LeFort I osteotomy, right iliac block bone graft procedure, and bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. He had previously undergone cheiloplasty, palatoplasty, cleft maxillary repair, and pharyngoplasty to correct the CLP. Preoperative laboratory findings, chest X-ray image, and electrocardiogram were normal. He had no other diseases, including upper airway obstruction or obstructive sleep apnea symptoms.\nHe had maxillary deficiency with malocclusion, mandibular prognathism, a scar due to a pharyngeal flap, and cheiloplasty. As a premedication, glycopyrolate (0.2 mg) was injected intramuscularly. Standard monitoring was performed in the operating room. After preoxygenation with 100% oxygen, general anesthesia was induced with remifentanil (1 \u00b5g/kg), propofol (120 mg), and rocuronium (50 mg). After providing adequate muscle relaxation, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FFB)-guided NTI was attempted using a nasotracheal tube (NTT) of 6.5 mm internal diameter; this procedure was performed instead of a direct rigid laryngoscope because FFB technique and smaller sized NTT are more suitable for adults who have intact pharyngeal flaps. The FFB was inserted into the both nostrils for examination and passed through the posterior pharynx; we observed that the velopharyngeal port (between the nasopharynx and oropharynx) was divided into two small-sized pharyngeal ports by the pharyngeal flap (). Because right side of pharyngeal port was a little wider, a scope was passed carefully through the right side pharyngeal port and vocal cords to the carina; NTT was passed over the FFB smoothly. There was no specific resistance during NTT insertion, but minor bleeding appeared on the nasopharynx. After the intubation, the patient was mechanically ventilated to administer desflurane (6 vol%), with a fresh gas flow rate of 3 L/min and 50% oxygen in air. After the induction of anesthesia, active bleeding was observed in the mouth immediately. To assess the bleeding focus, we examined the oral cavity with a dental mirror, and bleeding was seen at the pharyngeal flap. The flap was probably torn at the time of the NTI. Subsequently, hemostasis was achieved using a 4 \u00d7 4 gauze moistened with 1:1000 epinephrine solution. After the bleeding was controlled, cotton swabs soaked in 2% lidocaine and 1:1000 epinephrine were inserted into the torn flap and nostril. Subsequently, the pharyngeal bleeding stopped, and the surgery was completed without further complications. After the surgery, the patient recovered without any problems. A follow-up examination using a nasendoscopic view that was performed two years later showed that the pharyngeal flap remained intact after the recovery (). For this case presentation, we received consent from the patient.",
        "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?",

        "Patient Note": "A 21-day-old white male presented to the primary pediatrician for poor feeding, who noted that he had not regained his birth weight. Electrolytes were ordered as part of a failure to thrive workup, which revealed a sodium of 106 mmol/L, a potassium of 7.1 mmol/L, and a glucose of 1.8 mmol/L. After having a 17-OH progesterone level drawn, the infant was transferred to our tertiary referral hospital for electrolyte derangements with the presumptive diagnosis of salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\nBirth history was significant for an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. Birth length was 51 cm (65th Percentile). Birth weight was 3.35 kg (37th percentile). Apgar scores were 8 and 9. Hyperpigmentation of the scrotum was noted at birth. Hypoglycemia was noted on the first day of life. He was discharged on the second day of life.\nThe past medical history was significant for two previous admissions for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a maximum bilirubin of 367 \u03bcmol/L.He was treated with phototherapy on both occasions. His parents noted that his skin seemed to be progressively more pigmented over the first three weeks of life. This \u201cbronzing\u201d was attributed to phototherapy.\nPhysical exam upon arrival revealed normal vital signs and a blood pressure of 68/33 mmHg. His weight was 3.1 kg (7th Percentile). No dysmorphic features were noted. Genital exam revealed normal male genitalia with both testes descended. Phallus was normal in length and caliber with the urethral meatus at the tip. Physical exam was remarkable for marked bronzing of the skin.\nOnce in the pediatric intensive care unit, the patient was started on fludrocortisone and intravenous fluid support. He underwent a high-dose ACTH stimulation test and then was begun on glucocorticoid treatment at an initial dose of 28 mg/m2/day. Severe hyponatremia persisted despite the administration of 400 mcg/day of fludrocortisone in addition to 20 mEq/kg/day of sodium chloride. Diarrhea ensued. Escalating doses of glucocorticoid up to 54 mg/m2 were used. By the age of 5 months, he was weaned off of salt supplementation, and hydrocortisone doses were weaned to physiologic levels. Fludrocortisone doses have been gradually reduced.\nThe11-deoxycortisol values of theACTH stimulation became available early in this hospitalization and were consistent with 11\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency with markedly elevated baseline and stimulated levels of 11-deoxycortisol (see ). The 17-hydroxyprogesterone obtained from his primary care physician returned at5.6 pmol/L (normal up to 2.9 pmol/L). As 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and 11-deoxycortisol have been reported to be elevated in 21-hydroxylase deficiency and because salt wasting does not occur in 11-hydroxylase deficiency, 21-hydroxylase deficiency remained the presumptive diagnosis. The following day the baseline and stimulated 17-hydoxy progesterone levels returned to normal levels (4.5 nmol/L), arguing against 21-hydroxylase deficiency. He was evaluated for possible 11\u03b2-hydroxylase deficiency. A repeat 11-deoxycortisol after 12 days of hydrocortisone treatment returned to 1.49 nmol/L (normal range <.346\u20134.5).\nGenetic testing was sent for CYP11B1 gene. The coding exons and the flanking intronic sequences were PCR amplified and sequenced in forward and reverse directions, using automated fluorescent dideoxy sequencing methods and the mRNA isoform NM_000497 as the reference sequence.\nGenetic testing was also performed for the DAX1 (NROB1) gene associated with X-linked congenital adrenal hypoplasia. The coding exons and the flanking intronic sequences were PCR amplified and sequenced in forward and reverse directions, using automated fluorescent dideoxy sequencing methods and the NCBI reference files U31929.Gbk (DAX1, mRNA) and NM_000475.Gbk (NROB1, mRNA) as the reference sequences. This testing was positive for a new missense mutation not previously described. A T to C base change in the second exon was found, which substitutes proline for leucine at codon 447. His mother tested positive as a carrier for this gene. He has two older male siblings who have undergone genetic testing and have been found to be unaffected.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's corrected sodium concentration in terms of mEq/L?",
        "LLM Answer": "104.38",
        "LLM Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL. However, in this scenario, the glucose is given in mmol/L, so first, it needs to be converted to mg/dL by multiplying with 18, as 1 mmol/L = 18 mg/dL. Given sodium is 106 mmol/L and glucose is 1.8 mmol/L. Converting glucose to mg/dL gives 1.8 * 18 = 32.4 mg/dL. Plug into the formula: 106 + 0.024 * (32.4 - 100). Calculating this gives 106 + 0.024 * (-67.6) = 106 - 1.6224 = 104.3776, which can be rounded to 104.38 mEq/L.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "104.464",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia is Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100), where Measured Sodium is the sodium concentration in mEq/L and the Serum glucose is the concentration of glucose in mg/dL.\nThe concentration of sodium is 106.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 106.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 106.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 106.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 106.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 106.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of glucose is 1.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 1.8 mmol. To convert 1.8 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.8 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.002 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.002 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.36 g glucose. To convert 0.36 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.36 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 360.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 360.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 36.0 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 1.8 mmol glucose/L converts to 36.0 mg glucose/dL. \nPlugging in these values into the formula gives us 106.0 mEq/L + 0.024 * (36.0 - 100) = 104.464 mEq/L.\nHence, the patient's corrected concentration of sodium is 104.464 mEq/L.",

        "Patient Note": "A male infant was born to a 30-years-old mother with no significant medical history (gravida 0, para 0, abortus 0) who became pregnant via natural insemination. At 23 weeks of gestation, the mother was referred to our hospital because of severe fetal growth restriction caused by utero-placental insufficiency and was treated with antenatal steroids. Fetal maturity was ascertained by calculating from the mother's last menstrual period and was confirmed by prenatal ultrasound. Prenatal counseling was conducted for the parents, and they requested to give birth by cesarean section. At 24 weeks and 0 days of gestation, the infant was delivered by emergency cesarean section because of interrupted blood flow in the umbilical cord; there was no umbilical cord coiling or amniotic fluid staining. The weight of the placenta was 60 g. Placental pathology revealed infarction. No findings of chorioamnionitis were observed. Immediately after birth, he was wrapped using a plastic bag on a prewarmed radiant warmer. The ambient temperature of the operating room was set to 27\u00b0C (). He was intubated in the operation room with a 2-mm endotracheal tube and transferred to the NICU in an incubator. The admission temperature at the axilla was 35.8\u00b0C. The humidity in the incubator was set at 90% on day 0 in order to reduce insensible water loss, and it was lowered by 5% daily to 60% (). His Apgar score was 2 at 1 min after birth, 6 at 5 min, and 6 at 10 min. Apart from his size, his physical examination and laboratory test results were unremarkable. Postnatal maturation assessment was adequate for a preterm infant born at 24 weeks of gestation. Genetic disorders were ruled out as a cause of intrauterine growth restriction based on the findings of physical examination and ultrasonography and the results of blood examination including blood gas, complete blood count, and biochemistry. Hence, genetic testing was not performed. His birth weight was 268 g (\u22123.92 SD). In order to prioritize stabilization, his head circumference and length were not measured at birth; when they were measured for the first time on postnatal day 16 (postmenstrual age 26 weeks, 2 days), his head circumference was 18.5 cm (\u22123.03 SD) and his length was 24.0 cm (\u22123.7 SD). On arrival to the NICU, he was placed on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation because of low pulmonary compliance, and a surfactant was administered on days 0 and 2. Sedation was not performed. Anhydrous caffeine was started from day 0. Prophylactic antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, and fosfluconazole) were administered after birth and continued until day 6. Because the umbilical artery was narrow, an umbilical artery catheter could not be inserted. The infant's blood pressure was measured after birth via a 24G peripheral arterial catheter to avoid the risk of damage that a cuff would pose to his immature skin and was the approximate value expected for his gestational age; thus, no inotropes were administered. After the catheter occluded on day 8, we assessed his blood pressure mainly by physical examination. The target ranges of osmotic agents were set with reference to previous studies, and his albumin level was kept above 2.5 g/dL to maintain osmotic pressure (\u2013). Echocardiography was performed to diagnose patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) on day 1. We administered 0.1 mg/kg per dose of indomethacin, because echocardiography represented an increased shunt volume of PDA (, ). PDA closed after indomethacin administration on day 1. He required 45 days of mechanical ventilation, including 40 days of high-frequency oscillation (). He was extubated on day 45 (30 weeks and 3 days of postmenstrual day) when we confirmed that the prongs of our continuous positive airway pressure machine fit his nose. His body weight when measured after extubation was 518 g on day 51 (31 weeks and 2 days of postmenstrual day). From day 42, he received a systemic steroid (dexamethasone) for 10 days, as advised by Doyle et al. (). After successful extubation, he required nasal continuous positive airway pressure for 7 days and a high-flow nasal cannula for 116 days. Target SpO2 was set at 85\u201395% before 34 weeks of postmenstrual age and above 95% afterward.\nParenteral nutrition was started on day 0 via an 18G umbilical venous catheter. After this catheter became occluded on day 12, a 27G peripherally inserted central venous catheter was used, but it also became occluded on day 19. From then on, parenteral nutrition was continued via a peripheral venous catheter. On day 1, oral administration of the mother's breast milk using a cotton swab was performed by the parents, and trophic feeding via nasogastric tube was started. A maximum of 3 mL/kg of 5-fold-diluted amidotrizoic acid was rectally administered for 1 week starting on day 1, resulting in successful defecation. After 3 days of trophic feeds, enteral feeding was stopped because the infant's abdomen was gradually becoming distended. His daily abdominal X-ray indicated significantly expanding intestinal gas, and we diagnosed him with meconium-related ileus. Intragastric administration of 3 mL/kg 5-fold-diluted amidotrizoic acid succeeded in triggering mass excretion of feces, as described in previous studies (\u2013). Subsequently, abdominal distention improved, and enteral feeding was resumed. Fortified breast milk was used from day 20 when the infant's breast milk consumption reached 100 mL/kg per day. We maintained him on a breast milk diet for most of his hospital stay, adding medium-chain triglyceride oil from day 94 to 133 for calorie enrichment. The calorie goal was set at 120\u2013140 kcal/kg/day. Oral feeding was initiated on day 98, and the gastric tube was removed on day 137. During the treatment, blood glucose was managed within the reference range with glucose administration and enteral feeding only, except for insulin administration at day 1 and from day 5 to 6. Fluid intake was determined from vital signs and physical findings, fluid balance, and blood test results. Fluid intake was relatively restricted in expectation of reducing risk of morbidities and complications (). Transepidermal water loss was estimated based on the sodium levels, fluid intake, urine output, and previous reports (). Total fluid volume administered on day 0 was 65 mL/kg; for most of the period after the patient stabilized, it was maintained between 130 and 160 mL/kg per day. Minimal handling was conducted in all aspects of the patient's management. As described above, anthropometric measurements were kept to a minimum, and our patient's weight was estimated from fluids and nutritional balance and was adjusted on the day it was measured. After his first weighing on day 0, he was not weighed again until day 30 to confirm the anticipated growth. His body weight, length, and head circumference were measured every 2 weeks after that. Until day 42, we kept him in a prone position without postural change, aiming to prevent both gastroesophageal reflux and unplanned extubation. During that period, we undertook careful skin management, making sure to give him proper support to prevent bedsores. Although minimizing postural change may increase the risk of skin and pulmonary infection, there were only two events after the day of birth when we had to administer antibiotics: from day 38 to 45 for suspected aspiration pneumonia and from day 66 to 76 for cellulitis due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus at the site of the removed peripheral catheter. Blood sampling was also minimized to reduce the frequency of painful procedures and the risk of iatrogenic anemia. For a month after birth, heel sticks were performed as little as once per day to analyze blood gas, electrolytes, metabolic factors (glucose, lactate), and biochemical factors (albumin, phosphate, C-reactive protein). We performed a comprehensive blood examination (complete blood count and biochemical tests) only once every week or two ().\nIn addition to minimal handling, we encouraged parental involvement from the day of birth. Shortly after the infant was born, the family began to talk to him and hold him. The parents frequently visited our NICU to engage in physical contact with him, including breastfeeding, which was performed from day 1 ().\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the head at 45 weeks of postmenstrual age revealed no detectable abnormalities. An automated auditory brainstem response test was bilaterally passed. However, the infant developed bilateral retinopathy of prematurity (stages 2\u20133), requiring laser treatment. He was discharged from the hospital on day 176 (postmenstrual age, 49 weeks and 1 day) without any requirement for home oxygen therapy or tube feeding. His body weight at discharge was 3,238 g (\u22123.41 SD), his head circumference was 35.5 cm (\u22121.31 SD), and his length was 46.8 cm (\u22124.55 SD) () ().

        "Patient Note": "A 34-year-old man (weight: 79 kg, height: 180 cm), who underwent removal of an oligodendroglioma in the left temporal lobe 4 years ago, was admitted for the removal of the recurrent tumor. An awake craniotomy was planned. Preoperative routine laboratory tests did not indicate any abnormal findings. The patient had no problems with cognition or communication but complained of intermittent headaches with a visual analog score of 3\u20135. During the preoperative assessment, he was fully cooperative and understood the surgical and anesthetic (asleepawake-asleep technique) procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a hyperintense lesion in the left temporal pole and insula, suggesting the progression of a recurrent tumor. Computer tomography (CT) scans of the brain and skull radiography showed a bony cleft that was 2 mm wide in the left half of the skull (). Two hours prior to surgery, 1.5 g 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was ingested on neurosurgeon\u2019s instructions. Upon entering the operating room, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, and electrocardiogram monitoring were applied. An arterial catheter was inserted under local anesthesia for direct blood pressure measurements. The blood pressure and pulse rate were 124/62 mmHg and 57 beats/min, respectively. Following the intravenous administration of 50 \u03bcg fentanyl, the scalp nerve block and a ring block in the left hemisphere were performed over 30 minutes using a 25-gauge \u00d7 40 mm needle at the supraorbital, supratrochlear, zygomaticotemporal, auriculotemporal, greater occipital, and lesser occipital nerves. A local anesthetic mixture of 60 ml (20 ml 2% lidocaine, 20 ml 0.75% ropivacaine, and 20 ml normal saline with 1 : 200,000 epinephrine) was used. The patient tolerated the scalp nerve block with no evidence of intravascular injection.\nApproximately 15 minutes after block completion, the seizure occurred initially with a sudden move up his trunk, followed by trembling of both extremities for 10 seconds. His mentality became stupor with dilated (7\u20138 mm) pupils without light reflex. The blood pressure and heart rate were 167/81 mmHg and 78 beats/min, respectively, with sinus rhythm and an oxygen saturation of 100%. Although the seizure subsided spontaneously, the patient remained in a stupor with dilated and fixed pupils (right: 7 mm; left: 8 mm) with no light reflex. The operation was postponed, as it was decided that proceeding with the awake craniotomy would not be feasible, and emergency CT was conducted in order to investigate the cause of the seizures. When the scan was completed after 15 minutes, the patient remained drowsy but could respond briskly to verbal commands. His pupils were anisocoric (right: 4 mm; left: 8 mm) with light reflex. The CT scan showed a localized fluid collection and small intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) near the temporoparietal cortex beneath the skull defect ( and ). At 30 minutes after the seizure, he continued to remain drowsy but could respond to verbal commands. Pupils were asymmetric but responded well to light. At 55 minutes after the seizure, he fully recovered without neurological sequelae but could not recall the incident. He had a muscle power of 5/5 in his upper and lower extremities and a Glasgow coma scale score of 15. His pupils were isocoric (2 mm) with prompt light reflex. Prior to this, the patient had not complained of nausea, dizziness, or perioral numbness.\nAfter being closely monitored for 1 hour and 20 minutes in the postanesthetic care unit, the patient was transferred to the neurosurgical care unit (NCU) for 6 hours and 40 minutes. Since no hemodynamic or neurological deterioration was observed, the patient was moved to an operating room, where he underwent the surgery for 7 hours and 30 minutes under general anesthesia. The lungs were extubated in the NCU 1.5 hours after the operation. He was transferred to the general ward on post-operative day 2 and released from the hospital on post-operative day 10.",

        "Patient Note": "A 38-year-old man presented to an emergency department with progressive weakness and decreased urine output after having vomited up to 20 times per day over a period of 7 days. The patient was referred to our intensive care unit. Before medical consultation, he was healthy, and no other symptoms were reported. Diarrhea, fever, chills, or abdominal pain was absent.\nClinical examination revealed a patient of normal weight (height: 180 cm, weight: 70 kg). Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated (150/80 mmHg, 105/min); the respiratory rate was normal (13/min), but oxygen saturation was low (89%). During blood pressure measurement, a positive Trousseau sign was noted. The mucous membranes were dry, and the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\nArterial blood gas analysis revealed a metabolic alkalosis with partial respiratory compensation (pH: 7.71 [7.35\u20137.45], base excess: 40.5 mmol/l [-2-3 mmol/l], pCO2: 56.1 mmHg [32\u201345 mmHg], pO2: 43.5 mmHg [83\u2013108 mmHg], bicarbonate: 72.2 mmol/l [21\u201326 mmol/l], lactate: 2.8 mmol/l [0.5\u20131.6 mmol/l], chloride: 52 mmol/l [98\u2013106 mmol/l], sodium: 130 mmol/l [136\u2013146 mmol/l], potassium: 2.4 mmol/l [3.5\u20135.1 mmol/l], ionized calcium: 0.77 mmol/l [1.15\u20131.29 mmol/l] and glucose: 165 mg/dl [70\u2013105 mg/dl]).\nUltrasound revealed a distended and full stomach; the inferior vena cava was collapsing on inspiration. Otherwise, the ultrasound was unremarkable. The electrocardiography [] showed a prolonged QT interval (QTc 547 ms).\nLaboratory tests were consistent with acute kidney injury (creatinine: 5.2 mg/dl, urea: 176 mg/dl); liver function tests, coagulation tests, albumin, lipase, procalcitonin, total calcium, hemoglobin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. Leukocytes were minimally elevated (11500/\u03bcl).\nWe suspected a prerenal acute kidney injury and a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to gastric losses of HCl and fluids. Initial management consisted of oxygen therapy to correct hypoxemia and intravenous fluid therapy with normal saline and potassium chloride. Initially, a balanced crystalloid solution was infused, and later normal saline with KCl (40 mmol/l) was used because of the higher chloride content. Metoclopramide was administered to promote gastric emptying. To prevent further gastric losses of HCl, a proton-pump inhibitor was given. The patient was put on nihil per os for 24 h.\nAfter 24 h, a total of 4.5 l of crystalloid fluid was infused. There was no further vomiting. A repeated bedside ultrasound revealed an empty stomach. The pH was corrected to 7.49, bicarbonate was reduced to 48.6 mmol/l, base excess was 23.4, chloride was 69 mmol/l, and potassium was still low at 2.8 mmol/l. There was hypoventilation with a pCO2 of 68.4 mmHg. We noted onset of diuresis. After 72 h of fluid therapy, the acid-base and electrolyte status was normal. Creatinine had decreased to 3.5 mg/dl. Small meals were tolerated.\nSince there was no evidence of an infectious etiology for the excessive vomiting and the ultrasound had shown a distended stomach, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed []. A significant stenosis of the duodenum was diagnosed. Although there was no ulcer visible, an occult ulcer was deemed to be possible. A portal hypertensive gastropathy was diagnosed while esophageal varices were absent. Helicobacter pylori testing was positive, so an eradication therapy was initiated. A repeated endoscopy confirmed the stenosis, but again, no ulcer was seen. Since a focused abdominal ultrasound did not reveal the reason for the stenosis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed to rule out malignancy such as pancreatic or gallbladder cancer or a thrombosis of the mesenteric vein. There was no evidence of malignancy or cirrhosis. An endosonography was done without evidence of malignancy or mesenteric vein thrombosis. At that point, the stenosis had partly resolved, and endoscopic passage was possible. We concluded that the temporary duodenal stenosis was caused most likely by portal hypertension of unknown etiology, and our differential diagnosis included idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension after exclusion of cirrhosis and portal vein obstruction.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min? You should use the patient's adjusted body weight in kg instead of the patient's actual body weight if the patient is overweight or obese based on their BMI. If the patient's BMI's normal, set their adjusted body weight to the minimum of the ideal body and actual weight. If the patient is underweight, please set their adjusted body weight to their actual body weight.",
        "LLM Answer": "28.68",
        "LLM Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL. The patient is a 38-year-old male, so the gender coefficient is 1.\\nThe patient's age is 38 years. \\nThe serum creatinine concentration is initially 5.2 mg/dL but later decreased to 3.5 mg/dL after treatment; we should use the latest value for the calculation to represent the current state.\\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in meters.\\nThe patient's height is 180 cm, which is 180 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.8 m.\\nThe patient's weight is 70 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 70 kg / (1.8 m * 1.8 m) = 21.6 kg/m^2.\\nThe patient's BMI of 21.6 indicates a normal weight status.\\nWith a normal BMI, we use the minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the adjusted weight for the Cockcroft-Gault Equation.\\nThe formula for ideal body weight (IBW) for males is: 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet.\\nThe patient's height is 180 cm which is approximately 70.87 inches. 5 feet is 60 inches, so he is 10.87 inches over 5 feet. \\nThe IBW for this patient is therefore: 50 kg + (2.3 kg * 10.87) = 75.001 kg.\\nThe adjusted weight is the minimum of the actual weight and IBW, which is 70 kg since the IBW is higher.\\nPlugging in the values into the Cockcroft-Gault equation: CrCl = ((140 - 38) * 70 * 1) / (3.5 * 72) = 28.68 mL/min. Hence the patient's creatinine clearance is 28.68 mL/min.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "19.071",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female.

        "Patient Note": "An 11-year-old Thai boy presented with progressive abdominal distension for one month prior to admission. He had a significant weight loss up to 8 kg within one month, but had no fever or jaundice. There is a history of eating habits: eating uncooked fish, meat, and beef. He also had polyuria upon admission. On physical examination, it was found that he was cachexic. His weight was in the 3rd percentile. Generalized lymphadenopathy and marked hepatosplenomegaly were detected. Neurological examination was within the normal limit.\nHis laboratory data revealed that the hemoglobin level was 13.3 g/dl, the hematocrit value was 41.5 volume %, the WBC count was 15,100 cells/mm3 (neutrophil 60%, lymphocyte 30%, monocyte 9%, and basophil 1%), and the platelets count was 304,000 cells/mm3. Peripheral blood smears were normochromic and normocytic red blood cells, without blasts cells. Bone marrow examination and biopsy were normal. The chromosome study reviewed 46 XY, normal male karyotype. The liver function test revealed that the level of albumin was 4.9 g/dl, total bilirubin 0.3 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 0.2 mg/dl, SGOT 73 U/L, SGPT 46 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 339 U/L. Uric acid level was 6.1 mg/dl. The amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 149 U/L. Serum electrolytes showed that the level of sodium was 134 mmol/l, potassium 3.82 mmol/l, chloride 98.5 mmol/l, and bicarbonate 26.3 mmol/l. Hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia were detected; the serum calcium level had increased to 13.6 mg/dl and the phosphate level to 2.3 mg/dl. The blood urea nitrogen level was 11.7 mg/dl and creatinine 0.5 mg/dl. Serum amylase was 37 U/L, and serum lipase was higher than normal of 96 U/L. The amount of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) was 630 (normal range 15\u201385) U/L. Stool examination revealed blastocystis hominis. Chest X-ray showed generalized osteopenia (). The bone scan showed no evidence of active bone lesion.\nCT chest and whole abdomen (Figures and ) revealed hepatomegaly and numerous heterogeneous low-attenuation centers varying in size, with peripheral rim-enhancing masses scattered in both hepatic lobes, and the largest one was 8 \u00d7 7.5 \u00d7 11.6 cm in size. No dilatation of intrahepatic duct and CBD was seen. The spleen was enlarged, and the hypodensity mass size was 1.4 \u00d7 1.9 cm. The pancreas was enlarged with an ill-defined irregular hypodensity mass at the pancreatic body, and the tail size was 2.2 \u00d7 4.7 \u00d7 2.8 cm. Enlarged portal and para-aortic nodes were observed.\nInvestigations for hypercalcemia were performed. The intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level was very low 6.33 (normal range 15\u201365) pg/ml, while the 25-OH vitamin D level was 27 (normal range 30\u2013100) ng/ml. It was shown that secondary hypercalcemia developed due to malignancy that is most likely from the parathyroid hormone- (PTH-) related protein (PTHrP) producing tumor.\nThe level of serum tumor markers such as alpha fetoprotein was 78.52 ng/ml, CA 19-9 was 360.8 U/ml, and CA 125 was 267.10 U/ml while the CEA and \u03b2-hCG were normal.\nLiver biopsy was performed for diagnosis. Histological examinations of fine-needle biopsy showed poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma ().\nIn regard to immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells diffuse positive for cytokeratin 7 and 19 (), negative for cytokeratin 20 and synaptophysin, and lacked mCEA and pCEA ().\nThe patient was treated with vigorous hydration and diuretic; 20 mg of furosemide was given intravenously every 8 hours until the serum calcium level became lower than 12 mg/dl. He was placed on systemic chemotherapy; cisplatin (25 mg/m2) and gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2) were administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 8 cycles (24 weeks).\nThe patient was followed up with pediatric hemato-oncologists regularly. Physical examination and laboratory evaluation after the completion of the first cycle of chemotherapy revealed liver span, and the spleen decreased in size from 20 cm to 8 cm and 4 cm below left costal margin to just palpable. , respectively Also, the serum calcium level had decreased to 12.1 mg/dl, the phosphate level increased to 3.4 mg/dl, and the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level had increased to 7.75 (normal range 15\u201365) pg/ml. However, he discontinued hydration therapy and diuretics.\nRepeated CT chest and whole abdomen after the completion of the fourth cycle of chemotherapy for 12th and 24th weeks showed a decrease in size of the infiltrative mass in both hepatic lobes, the spleen, the pancreas, and intra-abdominal lymph nodes.",
        "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?",
        "LLM Answer": "70.0",
        "LLM Explanation": "The patient's weight is given as less than the 3rd percentile for his age. Typically, the weight for an 11-year-old can vary, but assuming a very approximate value based on the lower end of the growth chart, let's say around 30 kg for proper calculation considering his cachexia. For patients whose weight is greater than 20 kg, the formula for computing the maintenance fluid is 60 mL/hr + 1 mL/kg/hr * (weight (in kilograms) - 20 kilograms). Applying this to our estimate: 60 mL/hr + 1 mL/kg/hr * (30 kg - 20 kg) = 60 mL/hr + 10 mL/hr = 70 mL/hr. This means, the estimated maintenance fluid for this patient assuming a weight of approximately 30 kg is 70 mL/hr. Please note, this is an estimation based on available information.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "32.0",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's weight is 8.0 kg. For patient's with weight less than 10 kg, the rule for computing maintenance fluid is to multiply their weight by 4 mL/kg/hr to get the maintenance fluids per hour. Hence, the patient's maintenance fluid is 8.0 kg * 4 mL/kg/hr = 32.0 mL/hr.\nHence, the patient's fluid maintenance is 32.0 mL/hr.",

        "Patient Note": "An 82-year-old man was admitted to our medical center because of nausea and vomiting that occurred after the first oral anti-tuberculosis medication. One week before the admission, the patient underwent a routine-biannual health check-up at a local healthcare facility, and his chest radiograph showed consolidation in the left upper lobe (LUL). The patient received immediate medical attention owing suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient had been receiving routine-biannual health check-ups, and did not have any major disease, except hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He had no history of smoking and drinking. He had been under clinidipin and sitagliptin treatments for 5 years for hypertension and diabetes, respectively.\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate was 70 beats/min, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and body temperature was 36.5\u2103. The findings of auscultation were insignificant. Signs of collagen vascular disease were not observed, and the remaining physical examination was unremarkable. His chest radiograph showed an increase in consolidation in the LUL as compared with the observation a week ago. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a diffuse, patchy consolidation with ground-glass opacity in the LUL. Reticular opacities, on which our suspicion of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was based, were found along the periphery of both the lower lobes (). No bronchiectasis or honeycombing was observed.\nLaboratory findings were as follows: leukocyte count was 8,700/\u00b5L, C-reactive protein level was 103 mg/dL, and anti-nuclear antibody was not detected. Arterial blood gas analysis was not performed because the patient did not have dyspnea. The other data were within normal limits. Upon admission, 750-mg of levofloxacin was administered to the patient for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.\nBlood and sputum cultures were negative. The results of the serologic tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were also negative. On day 4 after admission, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed because the lesion in the LUL had not improved. Cellular components and lymphocyte subsets were not assessed for the BAL specimen. Culture, tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction, and cytology of the BAL specimen were negative. Video-assisted thoracoscopy was performed owing to increased infiltration observed on the chest radiograph obtained on day 10. Pathological examination of the tissue samples obtained from the anterior and posterior segment of the LUL showed that DAD was at its organizing stage ().\nWe immediately started treatment with high doses of parenteral methylprednisolone, and found that the consolidation of LUL decreased within 3 days after the initiation of the treatment. Further, antibiotic treatment was discontinued, and the steroid therapy was maintained for 3 weeks. A follow-up examination showed almost complete disappearance of the LUL infiltration, although reticular opacities on both the lower lobes remained ().",
        "Question": "What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?",
        "LLM Answer": "0",
        "LLM Explanation": "Initial SIRS criteria count is 0.\\nTemperature 36.5\u00b0C; criteria not met.\\nHeart rate 70 bpm; criteria not met.\\nLeukocyte count 8700/\u00b5L; criteria not met.\\nRespiratory rate 18 breaths/min; criteria not met.\\nFinal SIRS criteria count is 0.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "2",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.\nThe patient's temperature is 36.5 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.\nThe patient's heart rate is 70.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 8700.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 8700.0 count/\u00b5L of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 \u00b5L/m^3 which will give 8700.0 white blood cell count/\u00b5L * 1000000000.0 \u00b5L/m^3 = 8700000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 2.\nHence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 2.",
