  "prompt": "**Refined Prompt for Medical Calculation and Clinical Reasoning:**\n\n**Task Objective:** Calculate a specified medical score from patient notes using clear, concise, and accurate reasoning steps.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Understand the Task:** Extract all necessary information from the patient note to calculate the required score accurately.\n\n2. **Reasoning Process:** \n   - Execute step-by-step reasoning using concise drafts.\n   - Limit each reasoning step to a maximum of 5 words.\n   - Use symbolic representations, equations, or shorthand where applicable.\n   - Explicitly reference criteria, formulas, and coefficients.\n\n3. **Output Format:** \n   - Document your reasoning process as a succinct string, capturing essential steps.\n   - Present the final answer clearly marked in a JSON dict.\n\n4. **Conciseness and Clarity:**\n   - Focus strictly on relevant details.\n   - Prioritize mathematical operations and key transformations.\n   - Avoid explanations for actions; focus solely on actions.\n   - Ensure each step logically follows the previous one.\n\n5. **Example of Good Reasoning:**\n   - \"Age > 65; +1 point\"\n   - \"Stroke history; +2 points\"\n   - \"Final Score = 3\"\n\n6. **Accuracy Checks:**\n   - Double-check calculations to mitigate common errors.\n   - Verify the use of correct formulas and coefficients.\n   - Cross-verify against provided examples and criteria.\n\n7. **Error Mitigation:**\n   - Validate each reasoning step with criteria.\n   - For equations, ensure correct variable usage.\n   - Consider alternate interpretations of ambiguous data.\n\n**Output the JSON dict as follows:**\n```json\n{\n  \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Insert your step-by-step thinking here.\",\n  \"answer\": \"Insert final score here.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Reminder:** Balance conciseness with logical flow and accuracy to ensure the calculation is both efficient and correct. Always validate reasoning with criteria to maintain accuracy.",
